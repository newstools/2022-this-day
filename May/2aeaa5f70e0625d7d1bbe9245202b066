 Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The President, African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, has announced his withdrawal from the presidential race. Coalition groups of youth, women, farmers, the physically challenged and well-meaning Nigerians purchased the N100 million nomination form of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for him to contest. Adesina, in a statement issued Tuesday, said he was extremely humbled by several calls from Nigerians at home and abroad that he should consider running for the office of the president. He stated: “I am very touched by all who have gone to great extent, with such huge sacrifices of their own volition, to consider me worthy to be proposed for potential consideration. “The coalition groups of youth, women, farmers, physically challenged and well-meaning Nigerians that have done this have expressed their genuine free will, political right, freedom of expression and association for my consideration, with the interest of Nigeria at heart. “While I am deeply honored, humbled and grateful for all the incredible goodwill, kindness, and confidence, my current responsibilities at this time do not allow me to accept to be considered.” Adesina noted that he remained fully engaged and committed to the mission that Nigeria, Africa and all the non-African shareholders of the African Development Bank have given him for Africa’s development. He emphasised that he remained fully focused on the mission of supporting the accelerated development and economic integration of Africa.
