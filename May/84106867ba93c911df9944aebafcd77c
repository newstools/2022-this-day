 Hammed Shittu in Ilorin A 17-year-old  boy identified as Abdulkadir has drowned after an ill-fated swimming expedition in Kwara State. The incident, according to THISDAY checks, occurred around 4 p.m. at Ora village in Monasara, Ifelodun Local Government Area of the state at the weekend where he had gone to write the ongoing West Africa Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). According to a village source, “Abdulkabir begged one of the resident, Tosho, 10, and his friend to take him to a river and swim. “On their way, they met one of the school teachers who enquired where they were going and they lied to him that they were going to buy bread. “But he eventually died in the process. His corpse has been recovered.” It was gathered that his father, Mr. Abdulsalam, who resides at Idi-Ape area of Ilorin, had given approval for the son to be buried by the river side. It was further learnt that the other two boys had since been detained at the local police post where the matter was reported. The police, it was gathered, insisted that the parents of the deceased, Mr. and Mrs. Abdulsalam, should depose to an affidavit indicating they are ready to discontinue with the case before they can be released, a process that was ongoing before the filing of this report. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ajayi Okasanmi (SP), when contacted, said he had not been briefed, but a senior police officer who sought anonymity confirmed the incident. He, however, said the state Police Command has commenced full investigation into the incident.
