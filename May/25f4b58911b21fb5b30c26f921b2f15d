  Former member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and a presidential aspirant, Peter Obi, has finally registered with the Labour Party (LP) from where he will contest the 2023 presidential election. In a statement he signed, Peter Obi also commended his supporters across the country. He said, “I thank all Nigerians, especially our youths, who have joined me in the mission of rescuing and taking back Nigeria. “This project is yours and for the future of your children. I am just a facilitator. “Since I resigned from the PDP because of issues that are at variance with my persona and principles, I have consulted widely with various parties and personalities to ensure we do not complicate the route to our desired destination. “For me, the process of getting into this high office is as fundamental as what one will do thereafter. “Therefore, I have chosen a route free of rancour and one in line with my mantra of taking the country from consumption to production and that is the Labour Party, which is synonymous with the  people, workers, development, production, securing and uniting the Nigerians as one family. “I invite my fellow Nigerians to join me to  take back our country. “Be assured that I’ll never let you down,” Obi stated.
