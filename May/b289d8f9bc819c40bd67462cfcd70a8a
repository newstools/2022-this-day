HighLife  Great things happen for forward-thinking people. While some people throw their hearts into get-rich-quick schemes like politics, others are busy building important legacies. In recent years, Tayo and Ayo Amusan have shown themselves as belonging to the latter category. Thus, it is not all too surprising that they have found a new angle yet again to cement this fact. A few days ago, Tayo and Ayo led several Nigerian big shots to Jabi Lake Mall in Abuja. High-ranking public personalities like former Senate President Bukola Saraki and the global music sensation, Davido were eyewitnesses to the opening of the Amusans’ new flagship store. The store, Puma, is only the latest commercial project on the list of jaw-wrenching undertakings that Tayo and Ayo have brought into being. Perhaps the most brilliant of such undertakings was the acquisition of the almighty Shoprite in June 2021. Tayo took charge of the mega company’s operations in Nigeria using his Ketron Investment Limited, an affiliate of his better-known property firm, Persianas Investment Limited. All of this should not be overwhelming considering that Tayo and Ayo were able to establish something as prominent as The Palms, one of the top malls in Lagos. Indeed, Tayo and Ayo have come a long way since setting up and consolidating Persianas in the early 1990s. The married pair are well-matched, having the fortitude and confidence to continue, taking charge of the overarching momentum. It is said that Tayo is in direct command of Persianas, while Ayo is the active captain of the retailers. Together, they make a team that is unparalleled in Nigeria and indeed all of the developing worlds. So, as 2022 gradually unravels with its concerns and complexities, Tayo and Ayo are doing a wonderful job of giving hope to the common people. Their banner is business and their mantra is progress.
