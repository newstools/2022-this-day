Society Watch  It was Catherine Pulsifer who said: “Setting goals allows you to paint a vision of what you wish your future to be.” It is no gainsaying that Sijibomi Ogundele, Chief Executive Officer, Sujimoto, is a man of no mean repute. When the luxury property merchant announced to the world that he would be diversifying, some of his critics were said to have laughed scornfully while some others sneered. But the man whose ultimate mission is to rule the world of entrepreneurship confidently proclaimed his determination to elevate his company’s fortunes to heights never seen and scarcely conceivable. With his eyes fixed on the future, he held on to his dream. Consequently, earlier in May, he launched Homewin, which has now become a household name in Nigeria,  while it is gradually setting a new standard in the sector. With its popularity and acceptability, there is no question about just who is smirking now. What else could be responsible if not Ogundele’s Midas touch? After delivering such a resounding slap to the face of his numerous doubters who insisted on remaining blind and deaf to his incontestable greatness, the businessman is not resting on his oars. He has already set bigger targets for himself, which he is working harder than ever to achieve. On the menu are grand visions of turning his numerous businesses into a big, lean profit spinning model of organisational and operational efficiency, not to mention expansion plans geared towards widening his tentacles to other corners of the globe.
