 Former Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) and a governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State, Dr. Shamsudeen Ade Dosunmu, has vowed to dislodge the All Progressives Congress (APC) from power in the state if given the opportunity to fly the PDP’s flag in the 2023 elections.

The other aspirants are AbdulAzeez Adediran, David Kolawole, Jimi Karmal, Adedeji Doherty, and Rhodes Gbadebo. The party had fixed May 21 for the conduct of its governorship primary elections. Speaking with his supporters shortly after his successful screening, Dosunmu reiterated his earlier call on the need for all stakeholders to forge a united front to end poor governance in the state and actualise the objectives of the party in the state. Dosunmu, who holds the national honour of Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) for his contributions to national development, is reputed to be a tested strategist and administrator with strong professional, academic and family pedigree.
