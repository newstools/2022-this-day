 Hammed Shittu in Ilorin One of the daughters of the former Minister of Works, late Major-General Abdulkarim Adisa, Hajia Maryam Adisa, at the weekend joined the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara State. She, however, said the PDP has  remained the only alternative platform to advance the needs of the Nigeria’s masses. Until his death, Major General Adisa in 2005 was an elder and strong member of the PDP in the state. Maryam made the declaration when she visited her ward, Badari, in Ilorin West Local Government Area of the state, and met with both the ward and local government executives of the PDP. She also visited the secretariat of the party where she met the state executives of the PDP, including the state Chairman, Rt. Hon. Babatunde Mohammed. According to her, “I am venturing into politics to make a difference and contribute to the development of Kwara State and Nigeria in general.” Maryam explained that the PDP remains the best alternative to the All Progressives Congress (APC), which she said has failed woefully both in the state and at the national level. She noted that the maladministration and incompetence of the APC is responsible for the deplorable state of the country. Maryam added that PDP appeared ready and prepared to reverse the rot and restore stability in Nigeria. She also stated that she was inspired by the leadership qualities of former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, to join the PDP. The lady, however, expressed optimism that Saraki would clinch the PDP presidential ticket and eventually win the 2023 presidential election.
