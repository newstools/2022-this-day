When we did Maryland mall, our first major project, people thought we were crazy, because we said, you can’t be building destination location in Nigeria, you can do it in South Africa, you can do it in Mauritius but it’s a local one, we have traffic issues in Lagos, we have approval issues in Lagos. So, you have to do something that fits the market, which is why we developed for the first time in Nigeria the concept of “small format retail”: when you build a mall, instead of spreading it across the ground, you stack it up and you put it in a location that is easier for people to access without traffic and stuff, and Maryland mall has been a huge success and we are replicating that across Lagos,” Onunkwo narrated.Earlier, Chief Operating Officer, Purple Proptech Limited, Ope Adetiba, hinted on the plan by Purple to introduce home ownership arrangement by way of Fractions.
