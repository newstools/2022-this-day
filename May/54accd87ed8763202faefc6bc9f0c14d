 Made, grandson of Afrobeat Legend Fela Anikulapo-Kuti will be returning to his father, Femi Kuti’s New Afrika Shrine for a ‘Father & Son Experience.’ Shortly after the father and son’s Legacy+ album made it to Grammy, Made had embarked on a tour outside the shores of Nigeria with his father and the Positive Force band. “It has become a usual feature in recent times to see a feature of Made on a Femi Kuti set while the latter is on tour, and Femi has also featured in all Made’s concerts in and outside the New Afrika Shrine. This concert will be their first co-headlined show since their joint Grammy nominations. A show that seeks to bring to the home of Afrobeat the old and the newly converted followers of Afrobeat,” said Funke Kuti the CEO of  FK Management whose company is organising the concert. The concert, which will be heralding the opening activities of the 2022 Felabration, is scheduled for June 5.
