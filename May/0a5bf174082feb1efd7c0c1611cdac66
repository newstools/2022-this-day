 Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja The Department of State Security (DSS) has denied calling for tenure elongation for President Muhammadu Buhari. It also warned politicians against unguarded utterances. The agency said in a statement that contrary to some publications saying it was campaigning for tenure extension, no such thing was contemplated by the agency. “The DSS disassociates itself from the publication and categorically states that the information is false and obviously fabricated to malign,” it said. The agency in a statement signed by its Spokesman, Dr.  Peter Afunanya, said the presidency made known its definite stance to hand over power to a new president on 29th May 2023. Meanwhile, DSS warned politicians against unguarded utterances. “Politicians and highly placed personalities are advised to desist from making unguarded statements capable of derailing efforts to deepen the country’s democracy as well as mobilise citizens for national unity and stability,” it said.
