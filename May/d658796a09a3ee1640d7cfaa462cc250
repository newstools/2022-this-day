 Rebecca Ejifoma Four people have been arrested for alleged killing a 38-years-old Music Director, David Sunday Imoh in Lekki area of Lagos. While David was burnt to death, his friend Philip Balogun escaped with grievous bodily injuries. This was after Balogun had a heated argument with a commercial motorcyclist. This was, according to one of the victim’s friends, who took to Twitter to demand justice for the gruesome murder and grave bodily injuries on the other friends. He narrated the ordeal, “On Thursday May 12, Philip and Frank went to the Beer Barn on Admiralty Way, Lekki Phase 1 to set up for a performance that was meant to be held at the said venue. “Philip Balogun and Frank took a bike to Beer Barn upon agreeing to a certain amount. When they arrived, the Okada man inflated the figure by N100.” This, according to the friend, elicited some quarrel. He added that when Philip dazed the rider with a punch after he ripped his shirt. “The Okada man fell down from his bike and was unconscious for a moment. This got the attention of other okada guys around and this was where things went south,” the writer recounted. It was said that despite Philip’s explanations, the irate mob accused Philip of being a wire wire (Yahoo) guy who attempted to use the Okada man for ritual purposes. Meanwhile, David was said to have rushed out of the venue to prevent his friends from being executed, the angry bike men pounced on him and set him ablaze. “They tagged David as an accomplice. They killed him. Philip and Frank are still battling for their lives after police officers rescued them,” the tweet added. The States Police Spokesman, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, told THISDAY that four persons connected to the crime are in their custody, saying they will be tried and prosecuted. He therefore, warned Lagosians to desist from jungle justice, as anyone found will face the penalty in line with the law.
