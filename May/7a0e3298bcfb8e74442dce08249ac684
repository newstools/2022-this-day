 Omolabake Fasogbon Data-intelligence company, Towntalk Solutions has said that it is improving on its new service, ‘Pulse’ to strengthen security business in the country. According to the Chief Executive Officer of Towntalk, Folake Edun, pulse is an initiative that powers security companies to upsell services to clients and provide insights when needed. Edun averred that the service would drive revenue growth of operators of security companies who are already overwhelmed by market pressures to lower cost of current services. She noted that despite huge prospect in security sector, inadequate service has been a major challenge, occasioned by gaps in intelligence gathering and responsive emergency services. “As an organisation, we exist to fill this gap by providing the industry with tools and software to support the real-time delivery of core security services” Edun disclosed that part of efforts put forward to fill the gap was the development of Pulse, an artificial intelligence tool useful to curate, verify, analyze and act on real-time risk indicators. She said, “Towntalk first built an innovative data collection model by steadily growing a community of 45,000 trusted sources, created through strategic collaborations where verified individuals and emergency responders were given access to their area. “The strategic integration of community engagement and technology enables us to deliver early warning alerts, navigation, and periodic reports to businesses, travelers, and mobile workers at scale. She explained further how the company’s innovation also came in handy during COVID-19 pandemic and afterwards. “We were able to gather data when security and safety were on people’s minds at the height of COVID-19. We are taking our services up a notch by creating a travel safety package that  will allow travelers in new and unfamiliar locations to receive location-relevant security briefings and real-time support”, she said.
