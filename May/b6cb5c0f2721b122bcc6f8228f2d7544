 Jos, Nigeria MOJEC Meter Asset Management Company (M3AC), has continued its metering drive with the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) approved Mobile Meter Access Provider (MAP) scheme, as it partners with the Jos Electricity Distribution Plc to take meters to customers within the Disco coverage area and end the menace of estimated billings.The launch of the Mobile MAP scheme started in Abuja, with the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC); and then moved to Shomolu, Lagos under Ikeja Electric; and Sango, under the Ibadan Electric Distribution Company (IBEDC).According to the Product Manager, MOJEC, Engr. Mayowa Oyelakin, the extension to the Jos Disco coverage area was a further demonstration of their commitment and resolve to make sure Nigerians are metered in line with the goal of the Federal Government.Oyelakin stated that the Mobile MAP scheme came about due to customers’ unending calls to be metered so as to be saved from estimated billings that are not proportionate to the energy they consume.He said the meters will be taken directly to the consumers as they want to protect them from being extorted under any guise, which was why the prices for the meters were boldly stated in all communications. ‘’Under the Mobile MAP scheme, the approved NERC prices for meters are N63,061.32 for single-phase and N117,910.69 for three-phase (VAT inclusive), and the prices cover the cost of meters and installation”, he asserted.The Managing Director, Jos Disco, Alhaji Mammanlafia Umar, called on customers desiring meters to take advantage of the current metering programme, adding that the exercise was running concurrently in Bauchi, Benue, and Gombe states.Umar, represented by the Chief Commercial Manager, Engr. Mansir Nakande, disclosed that the cost of the meters would be amortized, as the company was working towards metering all its customers.He said, “All our customers without meters are insisting that they are being overcharged. We cannot say with certainty that customers are right or wrong. There are a lot of challenges with estimation’’.MOJEC partnered with nine Discos to spread the Mobile MAP scheme across Nigeria. They are the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC); Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC); Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC); Jos Electricity Distribution Company (JEDC); Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company (KEDC); Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDC); Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC); Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (IKEDC); and the Yola Electricity Distribution Company (YEDC).
