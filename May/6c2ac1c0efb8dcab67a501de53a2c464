We are now bringing our offerings to Africa, beginning with Nigeria. “Our core values are hinged on innovation, inclusivity, excellence, transparency, and thoughtfulness with a promise to consumers to continue to formulate natural and organic, innovative, solutions-driven, and high-performance products. “We understand that the Nigerian market consumer loves luxury, packaging, and results, which their white, black, and red label ranges promise above and beyond to deliver to the market. “We believe that it is high time Africa which has served as the largest natural ingredients market to beauty companies across the world, begins to truly experience African-owned beauty brands originally formulated from its roots that are cruelty-free, multi-functional, sustainable, and devoid of exaggerated claims, the latter which she believes is highly prevalent in the Nigerian Beauty & Cosmetics Market.” The company expressed believes that its entrance into the Nigerian market will not only grow the company but further Nigeria’s beauty market and ultimately Nigerian economy.
