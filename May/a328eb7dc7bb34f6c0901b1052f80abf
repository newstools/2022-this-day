  Hammed Shittu in Ilorin Former Nigeria Ambassador to Japan and a gubernatorial aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) in Kwara State, Professor Gana Yisa, has declared that he is the most suitable and qualified candidate to fly the party’s flag in the 2023 general election. Gana, an erstwhile deputy speaker of the state House of Assembly, added that former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, also qualified to aspire to the highest position in the country. The governorship aspirant, who spoke to journalists in Ilorin ahead of the party’s gubernatorial primaries next Wednesday, said with him as the party’s standard bearer, the party is assured of winning the gubernatorial seat in 2023. Gana, who said his time in Japan as the ambassador, which earned him the highest award ever conferred on a foreigner through his sterling activities among other things, put him ahead of every other candidate in the PDP in the state. He added that: “Among the candidates contesting for the seat with me, I am only candidate with experience in the academics, as a member of the state and deputy speaker of the House of Assembly and the international exposure at the highest level.” The former deputy speaker also said he has been part of party structures for a long period of time without undermining the leadership of the structure. Gana, who has been part of the success story  of the Saraki dynasty since he joined politics, added that all these attributes and loyalty should serve as an impetus for his emergence as the gubernatorial candidate of PDP during the primaries. The professor of Agriculture stated that the wide range of experience has prepared him for the job, assuring delegates that if given the opportunity to serve, he will not disappoint them. He, however, pledged his commitment to the success of PDP so as to bring a new political order in 2023, noting that: “Kwarans deserve new leadership, as the current leadership has allegedly failed to add values to the socio-economic well-being of the populace.”
