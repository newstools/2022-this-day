 In a bid to support local talents in Nigeria and give them a platform to showcase their talent, CHUPEZ New Dawn, the foremost leading phone accessories brand in Nigeria started a life-changing Initiative called CHUPEZ TALENT HUNT. The talent Hunt allowed Nigerians from different parts of the country with different talents, ranging from Singing, Dancing, Acting, Arts and creativity to show their talent uniquely. The initiative had over 200 Talented Nigerians show their talent by making videos showing their talent with a winning prize of N1,000,000 for the 1st prize, N500,000 2nd prize and N200,000 each for 8 contestants. Entries for video collections started on the 1st of March and ended on the 14th of April 2022 with a weekly Instagram Live session hosted by the delectable Media/Radio Veteran, YAW of Wazobia Fm. Each Live session had over 10 persons winning gifts and Cash prizes with one person winning 50k every Sunday. The live sessions encouraged people to show their talents and participate in the Talent Hunt. As closure for Video entries allowed entertainment industry experts to vet and cut down over 200 entries to the top 15 best videos that showed their talent and met the required criteria. To spice up things, The Chupez New Dawn Company decided to have the grandest of Grand Finales to be hosted by Senator and Mimi so the Season 1 can end on a good note and plans for the Season 2 will begin as it promises to recognize, uplift and reward talents in Nigeria.
