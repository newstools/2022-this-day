 Sometimes the underdog wins, and it is an inspiration for all of us. With the long odds Rich Strike winning the 148th Kentucky Derby we see a winner for the rest of us. Perhaps we should look for the long shots that we all need, a cure for Covid, Peace in Ukraine, honest politicians, and in general a better life for all but they are probably at longer odds than the horse. Keep fighting for the good things because eventually we will all win despite the odds. Dennis Fitzgerald,Melbourne, Australia
