Out of the Clinics emerged initiatives such as the MSME One-Stop Shop, the Shared Facility Initiative and the National MSMEs Awards.“The National MSME Awards was conceived in 2018 to reward excellence, hard work and innovation in the MSME space. The initiative has impacted thousands directly and indirectly, inspiring prospective business owners to strive for excellence.”According to him, 10 outstanding MSMEs in different categories will receive 10 cars and other prizes at the 2022 edition scheduled to hold next month. He said, “It is open to every person and there are no limitations. The only thing is that it has to be indigenous and the local content must be satisfied. Because you’re not going to take something from outside and couple it and tell us you’re the owner.” We are making sure that this is our own and we can beat our chest and say this is truly Nigerian and that it reaches a level that it is competitive with any other product.“If you have this kind of product and you are a Nigerian doing this kind of beautiful thing, the clinic is ready to book you for an award.The categories for this year’s awards include, MSME Award of Excellence in Agriculture, MSME Award of Excellence in Beauty, Wellness and Cosmetics, MSME Award of Excellence in Creative ArtsMSME Award of Excellence in Fashion and Style  and MSME Award of Excellence in Leather Works among others.
