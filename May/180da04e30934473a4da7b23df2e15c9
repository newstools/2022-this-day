The festival was birthed in 2018 and was aimed at enhancing the status of the prestigious African cultural facts and values in the international world. Due to COVID-19 concerns the subsequent editions couldn’t but things get better managed and handled the organizers deem it fit to put the event together once again. Gbemisola Bisi-Taiwo, CEO of TellAfrica and convener of TellAfrica International Art and Craft Festival, Dublin is an ardent lover of African Arts, Culture and Tradition and has established her organization to bridge the existing gap between Africans and those in the diaspora. The festivals started as a way to polish the African norms and values better to the public and ensure we are seen for who we are and not what’s perceived. Speaking more on this, she said, “We tell the African stories the way it should be told in a beautiful way as we are beautiful people. There is a dirt in the information said about Africans as people in the western world as they have the idea that Africa is poverty stricken and all sorts. They don’t know AFRICA is not a country but a continent. We tell the story of our culture, tradition, food and our socio cultural heritage.” The event is scheduled to come up between the 23rd to 29th of June 2022 at Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin. The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja ll and the Ga Matse, King Taike Teiko Tsuru ll of Accra, Ghana are the prominent African personalities expected to grace the event which promises to a showcase of African culture, beauty and expressions. Femi Adebayo’s new movie, Ageshinkole is expected to be screened at the festival alongside other activities set to give the guests an experience which showcases Africa and the black race for its true self.
