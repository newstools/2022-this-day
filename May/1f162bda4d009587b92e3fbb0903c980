 The Alapomu of Apomu, Oba Kayode Adenekan Afolabi, has officially inaugurated the new Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Outpost Command in Apomu. The event took place on May 18 in Apomu, headquarters of Isokan Local Government Area of Osun State. Oba Afolabi who was very excited with the groundbreaking achievement in the kingdom, said Apomu Township has felt the presence of the Corps in the few weeks of their operations as the ever busy and congested market was decogested by discouraging traders from displaying their goods on the roadside thereby causing human gridlock. In his speech the Sector Commander, PJ Okpe, appreciated the Corps Marshal for his approval to create the outpost command. He also thanked Alapomu for his esteemed relentless support ensuring fruition of the command, adding that he had taken the safety campaign to monarchs in different towns within Osun State and Apomu was one of the chosen ones to have an outpost approved. The Sector Commander promised that intensive and aggressive public enlightenment activities of the Corps would be disseminated in local languages to enable the community to understand their work. He urged officers and men posted to the Outpost Command to work closely with other security agencies and the citizens and shun bribery and corruption. The ceremony was graced by dignitaries from all walks of life. They include Majority Leader Osun State House of Assembly, Hon. Moroof Olanrewaju, Commisioner for Youth and Sport Osun State, Hon. Yemi Lawal, Chairman Isokan Local Government Area, Hon. Akinremi Moroof, among others.
