The son of late Kudirat Abiola, Mr. Abdul Abiola, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to make good his promise by bringing those who killed his mother to justice. He said this yesterday via his Twitter handle @AbdulMKOAbiola. “As this administration comes to an end, I would like to call on President Muhammad Buhari to investigate the murder of my mother Kudirat Abiola. “Her anniversary comes up in exactly a month from now. The confession of her murderer Sergeant Rogers must be investigated “The Oputa Panel is on YouTube and the court statements of your Vice-President are available serving as facts. “Since the Vice-President ceased to be the Attorney General of Lagos State the case has suffered a major setback,” he said. It would be recalled that Kudirat, the wife of late Chief MKO Abiola was assassinated on June 4, 1996, while calling on the president to name her martyr of democracy. “In the Women hall of Fame, Buhari’s government should name her “the Martyr of Democracy,” he said.
