 With strongly educative writings like those of John Milton and Stuart Mill, society, little by little, became informed and educated about freedom of communication or expression and saw the need to allow its unrestricted exercise. With positively non-conforming stands and activities of public spirited and highly courageous men like Socrates, Martin Luther and Galileo, society gradually imbibed the futility of repressing the human thought, conscience and speech. Today, not only are homo-sapiens informed that freedom of expression is the most important bedrock of individual and societal growth, they are also aware that it is a sine qua non for self-government, for peaceful social and political change. That is why we the members of One Voice, Ogwashi-Ukwu, Delta State, have come out as a pressure group to crusade for youth inclusion in the politics of Ogwashi-Ukwu and to influence positive development in Ogwashi-Ukwu. We are not a partisan but a patriotic group of sons and daughters of Ogwashi-Ukwu who are only interested in good governance for the benefit of our community and posterity. We as youths are saying enough is enough of underdevelopment in Ogwashi-Ukwu and we will use our influence to contribute to the development of our homeland. Feyisetan Akeeb Kareem, karfeyio@gmail.com
