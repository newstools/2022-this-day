 Captain Chris Onakorame Najomo and his wife, Martha, will be hosting the wedding ceremony of their daughter in June. The wedding ceremony is between Camille Omoigho Najomo and Christian Chukwudizie Ikeliani. The groom is the son of Sir (Arc.) Chris Ikeliani (Chinyelugo Oraifite) and Lady Ngozi Ikeliani. The traditional and engagement leg of the ceremony is billed to hold on Saturday, June 4, at the Oriental Hotel, Lekki-Epe Expressway, Victoria Island, Lagos. The colour dictated for the day is powder blue. The solemnization of the holy matrimony will be held on Saturday, June 11, at the Cathedral Church of Advent, Life Camp, Abuja. The reception will follow at Abuja International Conference Centre, Garki District. Earlier in January, the couple had performed their introduction ceremony in Abuja. Camille is a lawyer, based in the US while her husband-to-be, Christian, an engineer, works with Facebook in the US. The couple met through mutual friends some years ago. The very classy wedding is expected to attract the creme-de-la-crème of Nigerian society. Known for not doing things in half measures, many are confident that the wedding party will be grand. The wedding party they held for their daughter, Christabel, and her Kenya-born lover, Zacheus, three years ago is still fresh in the memories of their guests as it set another standard in the social scene. The father of the bride, Najomo, an aviation guru, is a director at the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). Her mother, Martha is a large-scale jewellery dealer. She is the CEO of Seraphina Gems, an upscale outfit that stocks some of the most exotic jewellery in the world.
