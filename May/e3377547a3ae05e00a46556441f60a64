Upon arrival of the Agency’s (LASEMA) tiger team at the incident scene, it was observed that a multiple accident involving a tanker with unknown registration number conveying about 45,000 litres of petrol and four vehicles had occurred. “A joint team of Lagos State Fire Service, Agency fire team, Nigeria Police worked to manage the flames and the resultant traffic backlogs using chemical foam. “The other affected cars were recovered by the Agency’s light duty equipment.” He said the entire area was blanketed with chemical retardant to prevent secondary incidents from the product which spilled into a nearby gully. He advised members of the public to refrain from illegal scooping of product to prevent any additional outbreak and to avoid igniting naked flame or fire.
