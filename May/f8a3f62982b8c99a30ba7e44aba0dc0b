 Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, has hailed Mike Itemuagbor, the CEO of Pamodzi Sports Marketing, organiser of the historic  and world-famous Okpekpe International 10km Road Race for helping make Edo a destination for sports. “I want to thank my brother,  Mike Itemuagbor, who has brought the Okpekpe 10km road race, an event to a small village in Etsako East Local  Government  in Edo State to the map of the world,” said Shaibu on the sidelines of the five-day technical officiating training course which began Monday at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin City . The course, facilitated  by the Okpekpe race organiser will see participants certified as technical officiating officials at the end of their training. Shaibu also used the ocassion to reiterate the state government’s support for the race. “We as a government are pleased with the giant strides the race has made. The project is in line with one of our cardinal pillars in the Edo MEGA (Make Edo Great Again) agenda because we believe it will create a lot of avenues for the youths in the state to explore and demonstrate  their God-given  talents.” Shaibu said some of the trained officials will be used at the World Athletics elite label Okpekpe race scheduled for the last Saturday in May. “For us in Edo State, we cannot be a destination for sports in Nigeria when none of us is officiating in the Okpekpe race, it’s an abberation. When we say we want to be a destination for sports, we mean everything about sports including playing, officiating, facilities and all that make up sports. We want to be the destination and place ourselves as resource persons in the development of sports in Nigeria,” concludes the deputy governor who has featured in almost all the editions. The Okpekpe international 10km road race is the first road running event to be granted a label status in Nigeria and one of the leading road races in the world.
