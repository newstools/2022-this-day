HighLife  Good things will always be celebrated. This is a principle that is written into the architecture of the world. The same principle applies to human beings. As long as the character and temperament are acceptable, the humble, the high achiever, and the ambitious will be celebrated. And when you are all three, as KieKie is, you are positively loved by all and sundry. KieKie has become the new face of Ruba Beauty and the number of people who are happy for her is enough to start a country. KieKie (real name Bukunmi Adeaga-Ilori) is a professional public figure in Nigeria. She debuted as a TV personality sometime ago but has gone on to become one of the most iconic content creators, models and fashion icons in the industry. A few days ago, the widely acclaimed Beauty Brand, Ruba Beauty, announced that it had made KieKie the Global Brand Ambassador of the beauty establishment. And KieKie just happens to be the first person to have that honour. Of course, the ambassador deal was not handed over to KieKie simply because she has a likeable personality. The lady is talented and diligent. Plus, she does not upend her wardrobe or dress sense simply because she wants to be followed on social media. Yet, she has more than 1.3 million followers, a fact that has catapulted her from being a run-of-the-mill content creator to a full grown influencer. Indeed, KieKie and Ruba Beauty together are a force waiting to rock the world. The brain behind Ruba Beauty, Mo Olowu, is as much a determined and charming individual as is KieKie. So, we can expect rounds and rounds of applause every time they collaborate on a promotional gig. Good things will always be celebrated.
