 Francis Sardauna The Katsina State judiciary has pledged to partner the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to curb corruption in the state. The state Chief Judge, Justice Musa Danladi Abubakar, made the pledge yesterday when he received in audience the state Resident Commissioner of the ICPC, Mustapha Abubakar Wala, and other members of the commission in his office. He explained that the partnership with the anti-corruption agency would go a long way in fighting corruption-related cases and create awareness for the public on the need to shun depravity. The Chief Judge said ICPC as an institution saddled with the responsibility of handling corruption cases would be accorded the needed cooperation in the state to fight corruption and other related offences. He said: “We had attended training; retraining, and workshops with the ICPC, and we have observed that when the judiciary is in isolation without rubbing minds with the ICPC, it cannot succeed, neither does the ICPC. “So, it is a necessary partnership, but we want it to go on a smooth path, and that has been going on. Now that you are close to us, I want to assure you that you will receive the maximum cooperation from us.” He, however, said the state Sharia Commission would also partner the ICPC on the training of the newly elected local government area chairmen and councillors to tackle corruption in their respective areas. He decried that previous local government officials in the state awarded contracts without paying the contractors, warning that anyone found wanting among the newly elected officials would face the wrath of the law. Earlier, the state ICPC Resident Commissioner, Wala, admonished the Chief Judge to designate Judges that would hear cases of corruption to enhance speedy dispensation of justice in the state. According to him, “We also want my Lord to consider the possibility of assigning magistrates to help us in issuing bank orders and search warrants.”
