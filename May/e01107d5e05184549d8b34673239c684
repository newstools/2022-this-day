 By Hammed Shittu in Ilorin Abubakar Belgore, Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq’s former aide, has declared his governorship ambition in Kwara. He is seeking to contest the 2023 gubernatorial election on the Social Democratic Party’s platform. Speaking yesterday  at the SDP secretariat, Ilorin, Belgore stated that his vast exposure in private business would be used to garner support for the socio-economic growth of Kwara. “My ambition is Pan-Kwara agenda, built on the concept of unity in diversity. I intend to collaborate with my fellow party people to run a government of inclusiveness, not only with the party but with Kwarans and anyone who desires to contribute to the development of a state of harmony,” Belgore told his SDP supporters. “I dare to set a new standard and activate the material potential as well as the human capacity of the people of Kwara. This I believe we can achieve together.” Belgore explained that he would collaborate with the private sector on agriculture, emphasising rice and sugar, promising to base his campaign on issues and not personality. “Specifically, it’s my idea that we would have a master plan for Lafiagi. For example, with over $300 million investment ongoing by BUA, we intend to have a master plan of that community and similar ones.” He further stated that as an architect, he would facilitate investment in housing and give a chance to competent people to run an effective local government administration if elected. Welcoming Belgore’s ambition, SDP chairman in Kwara, Abdulazeez Afolabi, represented by the vice-chairman, North, Ndanusa Tsado, said, “We formally accept your declaration. We urge every one of you as aspirants to sit down together and draw a template that will give us a rancour-free selection of the party candidates at various levels, particularly gubernatorial.”
