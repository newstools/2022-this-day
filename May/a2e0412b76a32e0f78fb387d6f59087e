Masari said he shut down the road in accordance with the power conferred on him in Section 176 sub-Section 2 of the 1999 Constitution as amended. He called on residents of the state and security agencies to ensure strict compliance with the new order to checkmate attacks and abductions of passengers by the terrorists. He, however, approved the immediate reopening of Kankara-Sheme road which was closed in 2021 due to banditry, with immediate effect for all motorists.
