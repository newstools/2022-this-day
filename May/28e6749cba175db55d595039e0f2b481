In quotes relayed by Watford Observer, Hodgson said: “Tom Cleverley has severely bruised ribs and then Sarr and Dennis with their knee injuries won’t be risked. Those names, you can forget them”. Nine hundred and thirty-one days after Dennis made his senior debut for Nigeria, he was handed his starting debut by coach Augustine Eguavoen in the 2022 World Cup playoff against Ghana in Abuja back in March.
