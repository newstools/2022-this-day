 Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia A female aspirant for the seat of Akwanga/Nassarawa Eggon/Wamba federal constituency, Mrs. Dorathy Gabriel, yesterday raised the alarm that she was under intimidation from men for contesting the House of Representatives seat of the constituency. Dorathy, who is aspiring to represent the federal constituency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), raised the alarm in Akwanga, when interacting with journalists. She said: “Honestly, it has not been easy from the beginning up to now. Most of the men I solicit support from were not accommodating. They turned out to scaring me away from the race. In fact, there has been intimidation here and there from the men on me. “However, their intimidation is giving me more courage and determination to continue with my aspiration. In Nasarawa State at the moment, the percentage given to women in political activities is less than onepercent.” “So, my participation is to encourage women, especially the youths, to also join in the political activities of the state.” She, however, said her desire to represent the Akwanga/Nassarawa Eggon/Wamba federal constituency was to fight for the injustice perpetrated on the constituents at the federal level in the area of appointments and citing of projects. Gabriel  expressed optimism that she would come out victorious in the primary election of the APC and consequently fly the flag of the party to victory in forthcoming general election, despite the intimidations.
