 Daji Sani in Yola A Young Philanthropist, Lt. Cdr. Ibrahim Babainna (rtd), has emerged the first candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) that would contest for the governorship of Adamawa State since the inception of the political party 50 years ago. Babainna made his declaration to contest governorship position in 2023 last weekend, at the Fasnet Cinema in Jimeta, Yola, where he promised to reinvent the state and give women, youths and all citizens a new lease of life. Babainna, who is also the founder of IBI Foundation, said in his declaration speech that his “vision of a greater Adamawa is one where every single productive citizen is gainfully employed in pulling in one direction: the socio-economic prosperity of the state, leveraging on speciailisation in agri-business.” He stated that he was motivated to seek to be elected the next governor of Adamawa State governor, Ibrahim Babaina said, “My journey to this point has been long. For years I have nursed a burden to assist in the upliftment of the vulnerable, the downtrodden, the forgotten and the helpless.” He added that such passion had led him to engage in various projects within and outside the state, but that he realised he needed political leadership to achieve greater results. “I have constantly been reminded that there are some degrees of change and impact on society that can only be attained through far-reaching policies envisioned and implemented by compassionate, visionary political leadership,” he said. The Chairman of the PRP in Adamawa State, Mr. Yauba Duhu, who spoke earlier during the Ibrahim Babaina’s declaration ceremony, said that the PRP is the party for the helpless majority of the people and that the governorship aspirant’s vision aligned well with the party’s ideology. He attested that though the PRP is a relatively unknown party in the state despite its old age, a new dawn had emerged and the party is up to claim its rightful place in the state.
