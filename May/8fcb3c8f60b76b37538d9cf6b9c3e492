 The Andy Warhol, brilliant artist, Marilyn Monroe, great actress, portrait sold for US$195 million. On eBay you can buy a child’s paint set for about $10. Which will do more for art, one painting, probably in a gallery or about 20 million children with a paint set each? The reality isn’t that simple, but it does suggest that the art market has lost the plot. Dennis Fitzgerald,Melbourne, Australia
