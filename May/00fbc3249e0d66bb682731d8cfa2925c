 Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The Forum for former legislators from First Republic to Date (All Progressives Congress (APC) members) has protested against the recommendations by the National Assembly to the president to remove their members as delegates to vote for their presidential candidate of the APC. The recommendation is said to be awaiting the approval of the president, and the forum called on the president not to heed to the call. This is contained in a statement signed by the Chairman of the Forum, Hon Umar Sadiq and made available to journalists in Kano yesterday. The forum further dissociated itself from any arbitrary move that will remove its members from exercising their rights as members of the APC. The forum also made reference to the party’s constitution chapter 12 which states the roles of the former legislators as accredited delegates in the states congresses and national convention, describing attempts to remove them as a violation of their fundamental rights, and by extension a violation of the Nigerian Constitution. Part of the statement read: “That any member of our great party, the APC, calling for our removal from being delegates is doing so to suit his or her desire to tarnish the good image of our party in an attempt to sabotage its chances of winning the general election in 2023, as it will reduce the chances of participating in a democratic process of the majority choosing a leader for our great country, Nigeria. “Since we have exercised and enjoyed the rights of being delegates in previous dispensations, we do not see any need for our party to change course when the need is even more important at this time of our general election. “We, therefore, hereby call on President Buhari not to heed the call of our removal, as he is a democrat and a shining example of excellent leader of our party.”
