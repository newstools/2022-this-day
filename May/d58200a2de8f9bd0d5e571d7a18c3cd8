 David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Charles Soludo, has pledged N10 million to anyone who provides useful information that will lead to the arrest of the member of the state House of Assembly and his aide. Soludo yesterday received with shock and deep sadness the news of the gruesome murder of Hon. Okechukwu Okoye, member representing Aguata II Constituency at the State House of Assembly and his aide, Cyril Chiegboka. Both Okoye and Chiegboka were kidnapped on the road by the heartless and barbaric murderers on May 15.The head of Okoye was yesterday found at Nnobi in Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State.His body was not there and indications were that the killers removed the body. Okoye and his aide were kidnapped at Aguata by gunmen who abandoned his Toyota Sienna car.The police later recovered the car and said that they had deployed operatives to rescue the lawmaker. In a statement issued last night, Soludo condoled with his kinsmen of Isuofia, noting that it was probably the same criminal gang that attacked him and killed three policemen at Isuofia two years ago that were on the prowl.The governor vowed that they can never cow Isuofia and Anambra State. Soludo vowed that the perpetrators as well as all criminals operating in Anambra must be decisively brought to book. He has consequently placed a N10 million reward for anyone or group that will avail valuable information that will lead to the immediate arrest of the perpetrators of this dastardly act. He promised that Anambra will soon be a hell for these criminals.“Anambra will win against the forces of darkness,” Soludo added.
