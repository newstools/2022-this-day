The cement manufacturing companies have been compelled to increase the price to preserve margins from the impact of foreign exchange devaluation.” He explained further: “For 2022, we are likely to see increased sensitivity from the private sector and also taking into account that this is a pre-election year. In pre-election years, you tend to see more cautious activities in the real estate sector because of uncertainties in the world economy. “For public sector demand as well, we don’t expect any significant effect in that space as we see preparation for the coming elections distracting policymakers from implementing the capital expenditure in the budget for 2022.” Union Bank, GTCO, Fidelity Report Decline in Profit as 12 Banks’ Profits Hit N281.56bn Of all the 12 banks, Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Guaranty Trust Holdings Plc (GTCO), and Fidelity Bank Plc reported a decline in profit.
