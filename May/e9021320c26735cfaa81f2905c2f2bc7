 Okon Bassey in Uyo A High Court in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State has consented to the terms of settlement in the case of sexual abuse involving a male student of the Deeper Life High School in Uyo. In a judgement, the court presided by Justice Ntong Ntong described “a consent judgment as a judgment, which provisions and terms are settled by parties with due effects given to it by the court.” Justice Ntong held that “a consent judgement is final, and cannot be set aside by the court, which gave the judgment.” The judgment was in a suit between Don-Davis Archibong, plaintiff, and Registered Trustees of Deeper Christian Life Ministry and eight others, as defendants. Counsel to the plaintiff, C.N.

The lead counsel also commended the Judge “for visiting the locus in quo, where he sat with all the parties and resolved the sensitive issue.” Kupolati described Justice Ntong as “an advocate of peace, love and non-violence.” Also speaking, one of the defendants, Mrs. Ndidi Solomon, who was the principal of Deeper Life High School, Uyo, thanked “God for using Justice Ntong to bring the case to a joyful end.” A member of Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor Nicholas Ekarika, expressed satisfaction over the resolution of the matter, saying the General Superintendent of Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor William Kumuiyi, and other parties were grateful to God and Justice Ntong Ntong for their intervention.
