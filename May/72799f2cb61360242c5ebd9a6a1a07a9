In the next couple of days, all the queues you are seeing in our filling station will disappear. Let me use this medium to warn marketers to desist from selling petrol in the night to racketeers. “This is a clear sabotage on government efforts in ensuring the availability of fuel in the country. We are aware that some of this filling stations have fuel but have decided to hoard it just because they want to make more money by selling fuel in the night to black marketers. “Anyone caught will be dealt with. We are currently partnering with the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, (NSCDC) towards monitoring the activities of these marketers who intend to shortchange the people. “The public should please report any filling station that is observed to be selling above the normal pump price, hoarding fuel or selling in the night to Jerry can owners,” he added.
