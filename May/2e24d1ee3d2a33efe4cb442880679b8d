 Sunday Aborisade in Abuja The Ahmad Lawan Presidential Campaign Organisation on Sunday said the Senate President has not dumped his ambition contrary to reports in some sections of the media. Lawan is a presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).A statement by the spokesperson of his campaign team, Mr Iyke Ekeoma, in Abuja, clearly dismissed the possibility of Lawan running for another term in the Yobe East Senatorial District. The statement specifically refuted reports of the Senate President, Lawan, withdrawing from the presidential race to pursue another term in the Senate. Ekeoma said Lawan had encouraged his supporters not to entertain fear as he is working tirelessly to emerge the candidate of the APC.He described as mischief, the reports that he had withdrawn from the race.Ekeoma also noted that those who planted the report were jittery of Lawan’s political popularity, regional acceptance and dominance in political space.He said the fake report was created to cause confusion.Part of the statement read: “Nigerians should ignore the sponsored lies by some aspirants to distract the Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, from his quest to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in the next presidential election.“Contrary to their unnecessary fabrications against the nationally accepted presidential ambition of Senator Lawan, we restate for the pleasure of progressive Nigerians that the falsehood trending currently in the social media that Senator Lawan had dropped his ambition to run for another term in Yobe East Senatorial zone is false. “It is understandable that Lawan’s entrance into the presidential race to compete against 25 other aspirants has become the major discussion as his entrance has changed the political dynamics of the nation.“The withdrawal reports are mere handiwork of politicians who are intimidated by the experience of the Senate President and his massive gains in the last few days.“The ambition to become the president of Nigeria after President Muhammadu Buhari is alive and Nigerians should be rest assured that he is in the race to win and not just to answer aspirant. “All supporters of Lawan should not entertain fear as he is working tirelessly to emerge as the candidate of the APC.”
