ThecCommissioner stressed that the approval of the contract was pursuant to Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya’s campaign promise of providing uninterrupted  water supply to the people of Gombe metropolis and environs. He said that the severity of lingering water scarcity had been a major challenge for the state forcing the state government to reach out to the federal government for partnership. He explained that the governor’s cry out to the federal government through the federal ministry of water resources had led to a signing of a memorandum of understanding. He said: “In pursuant of this memorandum of understanding a general assessment of the water situation in Gombe has been done and that today the council approved the contract”. The Gombe State Executive Council equally approved the contract for street cleaning and waste disposal at the cost of N98 million. The Commissioner of Energy Resources, Shehu Madugu, who doubles as the overseeing Commissioner of Environment, said the award of the contract followed the expiration of contract agreement between the Gombe State Government and Inex Cleaners. He said due to the paucity of fund and coupled with Governor Inuwa Yahaya’s zero tolerance for exorbitant engagement, the Ministry thought it wise to engage the services of two waste management companies at a much lower cost and expanded scope. The Commissioner disclosed that under the new regime, workers of Inex Cleaners who were retained will get a higher pay as against what they were being paid under their former employer. Also, the Commissioner of Health,  Dr. Habu Dahiru told journalists that the State Executive Council meeting approved the suspension of all privately owned health institutions in the State to ensure quality assurance. He said the needless proliferation of privately owned health institutions in the State without approval from relevant regulatory authorities calls to question veracity of certificates obtained in such institutions. The Gombe State Health Commissioner explained that the State Government will not fold its hands and watch the production of quacks in the name of health professionals, saying human life is precious. To this end, he said, a committee has been set up to interface with the institutions with a view to ascertaining their level of preparedness in training medical personnel. The State Executive Council also celebrated the Gombe State contingent at the National Science,  Technology and Innovation EXPO held recently in Abuja where the Gombe clinched 3rd position in the state’s category. The State Commissioner of Science,  Technology and Innovation, Dr.  Aishatu Umar Maigari said the feet will not have been achieved without the moral and financial support of Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya towards the encouragement of science and technology. She revealed that the trio distinguished themselves in inventing water stove, tea mixing machine and a mobile solar charger to the admiration of observers and investors. Earlier, the Commissioner of Higher Education, Mr.  Meshack Audu Lauco who is the overseeing Commissioner of Information and Culture said the award of contract, approvals and other decisions by the SEC were carefully taken in the best interest of the State and for the social and economic advancement of the people of the State.
