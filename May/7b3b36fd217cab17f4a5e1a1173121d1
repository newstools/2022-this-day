 By Vanessa Obioha At the opening gala night of the Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards (AMVCA) last night, Executive Head, Content and West Africa Channels, MultiChoice Nigeria, Busola Tejumola, announced that top Hollywood stars will be in the country for the eighth edition of the awards. The organisers flipped the script this year with an eight-day festivity to celebrate the creative talents in the film and TV industry on the continent. The talents are not limited to the filmmaking crew but extend to other creative fields such as fashion and digital content creators. The Hollywood stars expected in town include the American actress Tasha Smith and ‘God Friended Me’ actor Brandon Hall. Tejumola said their visit was an opportunity for the stars to know more about the Nigerian film industry and a great avenue for networking. The opening gala night was studded with Nollywood stars as well as sponsors such as Amstel Malta which has been throwing its weight behind the awards since its inception. In her speech, the Marketing Manager, Nigerian Breweries PLC, Elohor Olumide-Awe stressed that Amstel Malta’s core objective of headlining the AMVCA is to consistently build bridges and enable opportunities for the most active segment of Africa’s ever-growing population. Music performances were supplied by the four finalists of Nigerian Idol who awed the audience with their vocal prowess while Basketmouth provided comedy for the night. The gala was hosted by media personality IK Osakioduwa who is also returning to host the main awards on Saturday, May 14, alongside South African media personality, Bonang Matheba.
