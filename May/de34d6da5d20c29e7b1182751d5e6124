Sunday Aborisade in Abuja The candidate of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) for the Bayelsa West Senatorial District in the 2023 election, Mrs Tombra Mohammed nee Waritimi, has explained why she would defeat the incumbent, Senator Seriake Dickson, at the poll.Mohammed told THISDAY in an exclusive interview in Abuja that it was the time for the former governor of the state to leave the stage because his style of politics had become old fashioned in the area.The entrepreneur described her entrance into politics as a divine inspiration as she had not held any elected political office before.She, however, said since she grew up in the village and actively participated in their activities and trade, her people would trust her to manage their affairs better, having known that she has always identified with them.Mohammed said: “When I see Senator Dickson, I see him as someone who should leave the stage for a better idea. My father used to say, it is better to leave when ovation is loudest.“I believe that for him, he (Dickson) had served his purpose. The nation at this moment, needed the leadership of women because the world is yielding towards such direction.“The only people that God had designed to carry and birth a new thing are women. I want to restore the clanship arrangement when I become a senator.“If you belong to a clan, you will protect it and take ownership. It would end all forms of vices especially crude oil theft and destruction of public infrastructure.”The YPP candidate said coming under a new political party to contest the election would not be a barrier because she has always been identifying with her people who really trusted her.She said: “My people love me and I love them. I always carry them in my hearth. They see me as someone who understand their challenges and how best to tackle them.“This time around, it is not about the party but about the individual that is contesting the election. My entire politics now is about my people and their wellbeing.“I decided not to contest under either the Peoples Democratic Party or the All Progressives Congress because they lack clear-cut ideology.“I wanted a platform that would give me the freedom to actually realise my dreams of going into politics, so that by the time we triumph, our people will see me as one of them who came in on their behalf and that we all did it together.”She added that her people were hungry for a change in Bayelsa West and that she was coming in with something different in their best interest, in the oil-rich communities.
