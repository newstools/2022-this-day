Yinka Olatunbosun Following the Annual General meeting, held on Saturday 23rd April, members of Cartoonists Association of Nigeria (CARTAN) have approved the new set of Executive(s) to oversee the running of the association. The new exco include President Dada Adekola, ace Vanguard newspaper cartoonist.

Mike gave an account of his stewardship prior to handing over to Dada. A Committee made up of established cartoonists, Adewale Adenle, TAYO Fatunla and Modestus Ukeoma successfully midwifed the 2022 CARTAN election of the new executive transition. And beautiful was the air of peace that pervaded the whole process. Dada Adekola remarked that past administrations had performed remarkable well in advancing the progress of CARTAN and admitted that in every democratic organization such as CARTAN, a continuation of programs and at the same time a necessary shift in positions and administrative strategies, are inevitable, such as recognising that the welfare and professional opportunities of/for CARTAN members should be at the core of our projects, especially in this age of dwindling newspaper business, increase membership participation on our social platforms with bi-monthly professional critique day, monthly media exploration day and other activities and drive revenue through programming will be a priority.
