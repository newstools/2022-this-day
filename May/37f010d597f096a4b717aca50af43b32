 Daji Sani in Yola One military officer was yesterday killed in a skirmish between the Nigeria police and military officers, which resulted in an exchange of gunshots between operatives of the two forces on the Numan Road in Adamawa State. The state Commissioner of Police, Sikiru Kayode Akande, disclosed this in a statement signed by the spokesperson of the state Police Command, DSP Suleiman Nguroge, yesterday. According to statement, “The CP strongly condemned the recent conflict between police and military officers on Numan road, which resulted in an exchange of fire, and the unfortunate murder of military officer who were all in their line of duty to protect the citizenry. “Consequently, the CP has ordered an arrest and investigation into the matter with a view to ensuring that peace and justice reign.” The state police boss also ordered the suspects involved in the conflict to report to the headquarters for further actions. He warned that attacks on all security officers in the line of duty would no longer be tolerated under any guise, as the Command holds the lives of all security personnel sacrosanct, and such unwarranted conflict would be strictly treated in accordance with the extant laws. Akande equally reiterated the commitment of the Command to protection of lives and property, stressing that it is vital to work with other sister security agents to protect the fundamental rights of  security operatives in order to enable them advance their sacred mandate of serving and protecting the citizens better. He appealed for calm as the top managements of both security agencies are doing everything legally possible to address the situation. However, every attempt to get the military authorities to respond to the unfortunate incident was fruitless at the time of filing this report.
