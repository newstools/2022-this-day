Speaking in Ilorin with journalists yesterday while unveiling his agenda to the people of his constituency, Oyeleke said the people of the federal constituency deserve quality representation in order to re-fix the constituency for economic and political order in the area. He said: “As a politician with vast experiences and exposures that spanned over three decades, all these will be deployed to turn around the federal constituency for the overall benefit of the people of the area.” Oyeleke, who listed six-point agenda for the people of the area on empowerment, scholarship, good rapport with party men, social responsibility, job creation and enhancement of traditional institutions, said: “I want to state confidently that there should be no need for any elector in our federal constituency to call the contents of this manifesto into question because I have a sincere commitment to them.” The former lawmaker explained that he would ensure empowerment programmes for the people of the constituency so as to advance their socio-economic wellbeing, especially for widows, people living with disabilities, senior citizens, widowers and needy families. Oyeleke also said he would be a true representative of Ifelodun/Offa/Oyun  federal constituency  by ensuring that regular meetings are convened as an important feedback mechanism. He noted further that job opportunities would be initiated for unemployed youths in the constituency, adding that: “I will  sponsor and co-sponsor bills  bordering  on national  issues, economy, security,  education and others, and also  move motions on matters concerning my constituents. “As important stakeholders and custodians of the traditions, history and customs of our people, I will give the traditional rulers in my federal constituency the deserved respect and carry them along in all that I do.”
