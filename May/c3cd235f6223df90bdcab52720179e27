 Gideon Arinze in Enugu Business mogul and founder of Belemaoil Producing Limited, Tein Jack-Rich, has said that most of those who have indicated interest to run for the presidency in 2023 do not intend to work for the people but make more money for themselves. Jack-Rich, who is running under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), stated this yesterday in Enugu while addressing party delegates from Enugu, Ebonyi and Anambra states. The presidential hopeful assured that if given the opportunity, he will create social interventions that will in turn, create jobs for the teeming unemployed youths in the country. He stated that at the heart of the growing insecurity across the country is the widespread lack of unemployment opportunities for youths, adding that “if we don’t engage our population with the right economic policies that will create jobs, they will engage us in ways we will not stand”. “We need a president that understands the importance of providing jobs for the youths and economic policies for people to get jobs as soon as they leave school,” he said.  “Nigerians are among the most educated and smart people in the world”. He maintained that his administration will focus on giving youths the skills they require to succeed, adding that we will be on our knees if we have a joker as president in 2023. In his address, former Bauchi State governor, Isa Yuguda said that Nigeria is blessed with several human and material resources, yet it is still struggling largely due to poor leadership. Yuguda, who is the Director General of Jack-Rich campaign organisation, said that the country needs someone with answers to its economic and security challenges. “Jack-Rich is the best candidate because he understands the economy and will ensure justice and equity for all regions” he said.
