 The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in collaboration with the Airline Catering Association (ACA) released an updated Standard Inflight Catering Agreement (SICA). The two bodies agreed that the use of the standardized SICA template helps improve the efficiency of inflight catering procurement across the world. IATA explained that the release of the updated template is the result of an agreement to deepen the collaboration between IATA and ACA, noting that the two organizations would also jointly promote the use of SICA among their members. “The updated SICA is a significant achievement. Catering requirements are complex and a unique part of an airline’s service standard. SICA helps both airlines and caterers manage that complexity efficiently to achieve the results that travelers expect. And the collaboration between IATA and ACA has improved SICA by bringing together the expertise of both ACA and IATA. This was a successful first-time collaboration that we intend to continue and expand,” said IATA Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety, and Security, Nick Careen. “The updated SICA is a significant step that will benefit our respective members. The clarity that it brings to the intricate work needed to produce millions of inflight meals a day will help both airlines and caterers work more efficiently together. And we look forward to creating even more value for both our memberships in future collaborations,” said ACA’s Director General, Fabio Gamba.
