Testifying before Justice Sherifat Sonaike, of the Lagos High Court as the first prosecution witness, Odezulu, said the defendant raped her from behind after tearing her clothes. She narrated that the defendant ordered her to remove her clothes that she should stop behaving like a baby. The witness, who was led in examination in chief by the Lagos State, Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo SAN, said that before the defendant raped her, he slapped her and held her neck and she couldn’t breath again and he tried to strangle her and then tore her clothes. Odezulu, 29, a sales representative and a mother, said that on November, 25, 2021, after she closed from her place of work, around 8pm, she stood at Alesh Hotel Bus Stop where she saw the BRT bus parked. She said that she approached the driver (the defendant) and asked him if he was going to get her bus stop Jakande, and he said yes. She stated that she asked how much the fare was and he said N100, so she boarded the bus and sat at the back. The witness stated that between three and four seconds a man approached the defendant and asked him if he was going to Oshodi and he said yes then they started arguing about the price but later didn’t enter the bus. Odezulu said:” When I entered the BRT, the lights were on, but on getting to Lekki Conservation, Lekki – Ajah express way, he stopped the bus and brought out one medicine he took the medicine with one bottle water, so I did not bother myself because I thought it was a medication. “After that he asked me to come to the front seat, then he started asking me questions about my name, how old I am, who do I live with, in the process of asking me questions, he brought out his phone and talked about two transactions. “So, he concluded and said, back to our discussion, and said let’s go and park somewhere and discuss. I said sir, I am coming back from work and I am tired and I want to go and pick my daughter from care centre, that was when I noticed that his manhood, was erected. “ Then I brought out my big phone, I wanted  to call somebody and record what was happening, he was like what I’m I doing, who do I want to call with my phone, he got up from the driver’s seat and collected my phone from me. “ He held on to a small knife and dragged me to the back and said I should pull off my clothes, I was like why will I pull off my clothes, do I know you before? “We started dragging and he said I should remove everything because I was not a baby. He slapped me and held my neck and wanted to strangle me, I couldn’t breath again, then his face changed and  he said that if he kills me now, nothing will happen and nobody will know where I am that I should respect myself. “ He pushed me down at the back seat, I held the seats and was begging him, he held the knife, tore my clothes and raped me from the back. “ After that I told him to stop me that I want to come down, he said I told him that I was going to Jakande that he will drop me at my bus stop. On getting to my bus stop, I asked him to please give me my phone and open the door for me, then he started apologising that he was sorry for everything that happened. “He said I should give him my account number, I told him, I don’t need his money, but he said I was being stubborn, that I don’t want to give him my account, number so I gave him my account number and he sent N3,000 and said I should use it to buy pain killers. The witness further said, he demanded  her phone number, before  he returned her phone  back to her. “I gave him my phone number, before he gave me back my phone and then opened the BRT door. Then I used my big  phone to record the plate number from the back. “Few hours later he called me and said he was sorry, and asked me if I had gotten home, and picked my daughter from after school, but I did not answer any of his questions then I ended the call. He called me back the next day and subsequently but I did not pick his calls. She also said that “After the incident, whenever I’m coming back from work and see any BRT Bus, I use to look inside to see if it was him. I have seen him like four times, at that Chevron Tollgate”, Odezulu said.
