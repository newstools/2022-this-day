 Omolabake Fasogbon The Nigerian Red Cross Society, has beefed up  safety efforts against flood disaster in Ikorodu area of Lagos as part of its disaster management programme. This is as  Lagos State government recently alerted residents of incoming heavy rains that  amount to 1,750mm in 2022. The society explained that Ikorodu came as a priority for its intervention in Lagos given its topography and vulnerability to high flood levels. President of the Nigerian Red Cross Society,  Bolaji Anani who spoke at the inauguration of   Odo Ogun Community pedestrian bridge in  Kosofe Local Government, Ikorodu explained that the move was to prepare  residents better for disaster and to aid in response effort in case of emergency. He noted that the  disaster management programme, which was implemented in  partnership with the British Red Cross, also included Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project and supplies of disaster management working tools. Earlier during a high level visit of  the British Red Cross to the Oba of Ikorodu,  its Country Manager, Mr. Karsten Voigt, pleaded for  more volunteers in the community to support the society’s activities. He said: “We are working to contain flood effect in Lagos, Imo and FCT. Our focus is preparedness for and response to disasters. Once there are rain and flood, the marginalised communities are most affected. We hope to have more volunteers, particularly youths to aid our efforts.” Responding, Oba of Ikorodu,Oba Kabiru Shotobi  commended the humanitarian gesture and expressed strong willingness to work with the society towards the development of the community.
