 Emameh Gabriel in Abuja Less than two weeks after declaring to contest the All Progressives Congress’ presidential primary election, it has been confirmed that former Governor Adams Oshiomhole is no longer in the race to become the next president of Nigeria. A credible source close to the former APC national chairman told THISDAY that Oshiomhole was no longer in the race due to what he described as “political and strategic reasons.” The source further confirmed to THISDAY that Oshiomhole did not purchase the APC presidential nomination form because he was prevailed upon by APC stakeholders to concentrate on his senatorial ambition and align with APC national leader Bola Tinubu, a frontline presidential hopeful of the APC. “People assumed that he (Oshiomhole) has paid for the form. He wanted to buy, but he now said okay, what is the purpose since we are on the same page with Asiwaju. So what is the purpose of buying the form? However, we had already made a point,” the source, an APC chieftain, said. He added, “He (Oshiomhole) wanted to talk about the issues, and he did. He didn’t buy the form at all. He was prevailed upon to go for the Senate.” Oshiomhole had, on April 4 in Abuja, declared to contest to clinch the APC presidential ticket. He had vowed to run an economy that would ensure even distribution of wealth to Nigerians. His objectives were to reform the banking sector and other ailing sectors, including education in Nigeria, particularly the perennial ASUU-federal government crisis, if elected president. Despite speculations that he paid N100 million for the presidential nomination form and launched his presidential campaign with fanfare, Oshiomhole was screened by the party for Edo North senatorial seat at the weekend. The development might again bring him in direct collision with Senator Francis Alimikhena, the APC member representing Edo North senatorial district.
