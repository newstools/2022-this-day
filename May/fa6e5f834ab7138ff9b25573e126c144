 By John Shiklam in Kaduna A winner was yet to emerge in Saturday’s senatorial primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Kaduna North Senatorial Zone as the process was reportedly disrupted by armed thugs in Zaria. Three aspirants, including the incumbent Senator Suleman Kwari, Turad Sani Sha’aban, President Muhammadu Buhari’s in-law, and Haliru Ibrahim are contenders for the position. Turad’s father, Sani Sha’aban, who was an aspirant in the Kaduna APC governorship primaries, lost to Senator Uba Sani, though he has rejected the outcome of the election. According to agency reports, cameras and other electronic gadgets belonging to some journalists were confiscated by the thugs supporting one of the aspirants. Some delegates were also reportedly injured by the hoodlums who were said to be brandishing different types of weapons. In the Kaduna South Senatorial District, Bulus Audu, emerged as the APC’s candidate for the Kaduna South senatorial seat. Audu was declared unopposed following the withdrawal of Chief Anthony Hassan, his only opponent in the contest few minutes before the commencement of the election which held Saturday in Kafanchan.
