Eziafa Samuel Enwedo & Obinna Uzoh. “The above shows that the aspirant deliberately failed to disclose the facts of this charge, his arraignment and trial. “He was asked if he had been indicted by a Court or Tribunal. He answered in the negative, but facts available show that he was admitted to bail. July 7 July 2020 by Hon. Justice O.E Abang,” it stated.
