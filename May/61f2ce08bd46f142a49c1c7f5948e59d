The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) who are currently involved in an ongoing joint rescue operation with the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency and the Police have since evacuated the 23 survivors while eight  persons had reportedly died in the collapsed building. The emergency response operatives are continuing the search and rescue operation to rescue other tenants trapped in the building.

I commiserate with the government and people of Lagos state over this tragedy. “My prayers go to the families of those who have lost their lives in this collapsed building and rescued victims who were injured in the incident. “As soon as the news of the building collapse on Ibadan Street, Ebute Metta Lagos broke, NEMA was activated to respond along with other relevant disaster risk first responders. Unfortunately, many people were trapped in the building and many lives were lost. “It is also important that those in charge of ensuring the construction of standard buildings in the country ensure that the highest standards are met to avoid these tragedies”.
