HighLife We will never get tired of iterating the popular words of English historian, politician, and writer, John Acton: power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. In truth, there are many ways to see the alleged role of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu in the senatorial bid of Ondo State businessman Jimoh Billionaire. The abuse of power is one of the easiest to point to. Of course, whether this is alright or not is left to the reader’s discretion. It is no longer news that the venerable businessman, Chairman and CEO of Global Fleet Group, Ibrahim, has his eyes on the Ondo South Senatorial District. According to reports on this front, Ibrahim intends to run for Senator of the senatorial district under the aegis of the All Progressives Congress (APC). There is nothing bad about this, as many people have noted, except that there appears to be some shadows behind the aspirant. One of these shadows is Akeredolu. According to those in the know, it is Akeredolu’s wish that Ibrahim ends up with the APC primary ticket and also goes on to be Ondo South Senator. And since Akeredolu is APC Member Number 1 in Ondo, his will must be done. What is interesting about this entire proposition is that Akeredolu and Ibrahim are allegedly very close. In fact, Ibrahim’s desire to become a senator and Akeredolu’s intention to indulge this desire is reportedly based on the fact that Ibrahim assisted Akeredolu during the governorship election that saw him into office. Thus, this is the perfect opportunity for Akeredolu to show his gratitude to the Global Fleet man. But there is another shadow behind Ibrahim, and that is the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). The latter is allegedly intent on seizing Ibrahim’s assets because he reportedly owes N69 billion. Unfortunately, while Akeredolu may be able to get Ibrahim the APC senatorial ticket, there is nothing that the governor can do about AMCON’s crosshairs.
