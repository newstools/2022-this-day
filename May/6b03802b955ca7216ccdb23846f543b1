 To celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD), Netflix has expanded the language availability of Audio Descriptions (AD) and Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (SDH). Starting this month and into 2023, these features will be made available across the streamer’s catalogue and in more languages including Spanish, Portuguese, and French. “For decades, your access to entertainment was determined by where you lived and what language you spoke, meaning that until recently people who needed AD or SDH could only enjoy a story if it was made in their local language,” said Netflix’s Director of Product Accessibility, Heather Dowdy. New badges shows and films that have AD and SDH on Web and iOS are also introduced. Taking a step further, Netflix launched its first-ever collection, titled ‘Celebrating Disability with Dimension’ which features over 50 shows and films with characters or stories about people living with disabilities.
