 All is now set for Edo State to host the best of the Nigeria’s Women Football League (NWFL), the Super Six Tournament starting Monday, May 16 through May 22. Six giants in the fast-developing women league will battle for the sole ticket to represent Nigeria at the continental second edition of the CAF Women Champions League. The six participating teams include host state team, Edo Queens, defending champion Rivers Angels, Bayelsa Queens, new corners, Naija Ratels, Nasarawa Amazons and runners up in the first edition, Delta Queens. The teams qualified from two groups based on their placement in each group in the regular season. While Nasarawa Amazons, Edo Queens and Naija Ratels emerged the three best teams from their group, Bayelsa Queens, Rivers Angels and Delta Queens outwitted other teams to pick the three available tickets from their group. Edo Queens who narrowly lost the top spot by a point to Nasarawa Amazons at the conclusion of the 2021/2022 regular season is poised to clinch the top prize going by preparations, motivation by the state government and support by the home fans in Benin. The Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium and the University of Benin Sports Complex are the two venues with three matches scheduled daily. Two games will be played simultaneously by 10am and 4pm respectively. The hosting of the Nigeria Women Football League Super 6 is a pointer to the fact that Edo State is a sports hub.
