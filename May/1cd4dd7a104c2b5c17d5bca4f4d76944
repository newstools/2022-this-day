 Rivers United’s dream to extend the leadership of the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) was aborted by hosts Heartland FC yesterday. The Naze Millionaires snatched a 2-0 victory to leave the Pride of Rivers People on their 58 points from 28 matches. Second placed Plateau United on 51 points are at host to Wikki Tourists to see if they can do some catch up with Rivers United. Heartland missed the chance to take the lead early in the first half when Chukwudi Nwaodu missed from the penalty spot. The Imo State owned  team however went in front in the 54th minute, with Sunday Chinedu nodding home Nwaodu’s corner-kick. Chijoke Mbaoma put the game beyond the hosts seven minutes later following a defence-splitting pass from substitute, Alexander Alfred. Former champions Enyimba moved up to fifth position courtesy of a 2-1 win against Lobi Stars in Aba. Samuel Kalu headed in Sadiq Abubakar’s cross in the 54th minute to hand Enyimba the lead. Samuel Stone scored the second goal for Enyimba four minutes from time after Austine Oladapo’s shot was deflected to his path inside the box.
