 Ugo Aliogo Agri-Foodtech brand, Vendease, has impacted members of the Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria (AMBCN), Ikorodu Branch with an intensive business management training at their secretariat in Ikorodu, Lagos on the 10th of May 2022. The training was organised as part of the brand’s Corperate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative. Speaking, the Head of Marketing, Febechi Archibong: “As a food technology brand, we are always seeking ways to impact and support the food value chain and you can agree that baked goods like bread are a staple in this clime. So, we thought, what better way to support than provide the right education and tools to help these small businesses grow. We know that artisanal and other relatively small-medium regional players who account for about 72% of the market, dominate the baked goods sub-sector. We cannot overemphasise the significance of this set of people.” One of the participants of the training, Mrs Adepoju Kehinde, said: “This is a nice initiative by Vendease, it’s a real eye opener. I am certain that my records will be better with the knowledge I’ve gained from this training session.” The Chairman of the Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria (AMBCN) Lagos Chapter, Alhaji Raji Omotunde expressed appreciation for the initiative citing the importance of knowledge sharing to the association and its members.
