 Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr.  Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on Thursday night stormed Kano to seek the support of delegates and other stakeholders ahead of the presidential primary of APC. Tinubu’s visit came days after two presidential aspirants Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amechi, visited the state to also woo the delegates. While canvassing for votes of the delegates, the former Lagos State governor urged them not to make a mistake of voting anybody other than him. “I hereby appeal to you to support my presidential ambition by voting for me to clinch the party’s ticket at the forthcoming primary election. “Today is the day I have come to ask for your support to be president of Nigeria. You can put me there with your votes. “I believe in myself, I’m smart, intelligent and courageous, don’t make mistakes, choose wisely, choose me, I beg you and you will never regret supporting me.” Tinubu met with APC leaders and delegates at Coronation Hall, Government House, Kano, and promised to tackle insecurity, revamp the economy, provide good roads to enable farmers to bring their produce to markets across the country. He further said that to develop and make the agricultural sector more lucrative, the country needs the formation of a commodity exchange mechanism. “Commodity exchange is to guarantee to the farmers that there is a market for all the produce that is coming,” he said. Also in his remarks, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, said it was pay-back for Tinubu who worked greatly for the growth and development of the APC. Ganduje said that Nigerians were yearning for a candidate who really understands the challenges of the nation and who is experienced enough to reposition the country. Tinubu had earlier visited elder statesman, Alhaji Aminu Dantata who celebrated his 91st birthday and his (Tinubu’s) long time friend, Alhaji Yusuf Ali.
