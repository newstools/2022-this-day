 Bennett Oghifo Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, an aspirant in the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has said he is no longer interested in the race. In a statement issued yesterday by his associates, Olawepo-Hashim said he decided to withdraw, “after a series of consultations and reflections on current developments in the political scene. “Certain developments have necessitated my withdrawal from the 2023 presidential race, as a result of which I did not pick the nomination form.” Olawepo-Hashim, who had similar presidential ambitions in 2019 on the platform of the People’s Trust Party, said he was “retreating not out of the lack of will to fight for our resolve and collective aspiration for a New Nigeria, a struggle which has attracted enormous support.” He said, “It is a tough decision for me, but in the present circumstance it is the best thing in my judgement to do. “Sometimes will and resolve, energy and preparation may not be enough to engage in an encounter,” adding that he was not quitting on Nigeria, but only putting his presidential aspiration on pause. According to him, his resolve “is not an ambition but a historic burden, as a team player. My current political pursuit must now bow to our collective National interest. It is not about me but about Nigeria. “I stepped aside believing that another day will come. I hope our party will still be able to find a candidate for the 2023 election that will unite and secure our country. “One that will lead an inclusive government, and build a prosperous economy that will not leave anyone behind. I leave the race believing that by the Grace of God my own day will come.”
