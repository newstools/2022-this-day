Alex Enumah The leadership of the umbrella body for lawyers in the country, Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), on Monday called on the Government of Sokoto State to demonstrate seriousness and willingness in its prosecution of alleged culprits in the murder of a young Christian student in the state by ensuring that charges preferred against the defendants are a true reflection of the gravity of the offence of murder.The NBA, in a statement signed by its President, Mr Olumide Akpata, expressed concern over the level of degeneration in the country, adding that it has further exposed the weakness in the country’s “security architecture, tested our collective resolve as a people, and significantly threatened the unity of Nigeria as a nation”. While, Miss Deborah Yakubu, a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto was cruelly murdered by some of her school mates for alleged blasphemy last Thursday, the news of the gruesome killing of security personnel by “unknown gunmen” was reported in the South-east, followed by the lynching of a young man (simply identified as David) by commercial motorcyclists around Lekki, Lagos State was reported.The NBA, while expressing sadness and condemnation over the spate of extra-judicial killings in any part of the country, described it as reprehensible, barbaric and unacceptable and called on security agencies and the government to immediately move to checkmate the menace.“The government should immediately commence the prosecution of all suspects involved in these brutal and arbitrary killings in order to send a strong signal that such acts will no longer be tolerated in Nigeria. “The NBA also believes that the prompt and effective prosecution of the alleged killers will instil confidence in the citizens, promote accountability and signpost the government’s commitment to the rule of law.“With particular reference to the murder of Miss Deborah Yakubu and related developments in Sokoto, we note that some arrests have been made by the Nigeria Police and that the suspects are now being prosecuted. We are, however, worried by yet-to-be confirmed reports reaching us that the suspects have been charged with mere breach of public peace in an episode that cut short Deborah’s life in her prime. “The NBA is strongly opposed to a banalisation of the situation, and if these reports are true, then we call on the Sokoto State Government to immediately rethink its prosecution strategy and file charges that truly reflect the gravity of the situation,” the statement read in part.While observing that expectation of Nigerians and the international community is that the culprits are brought to justice speedily for the appropriate offences, Akpata remarked that the demand for the release of the suspects by some protesting youths coupled with assault on innocent citizens, burning of worship centres and destruction of property have added an entirely new and worrisome dimension to the unfortunate incident. He disclosed that following the development, the NBA has decided to postpone the 2022 NBA Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL) billed for Sokoto State in honour of Miss Deborah Yakubu. “Accordingly, the Executive Committee of NBA-SPIDEL came to the painful decision to request, and I have approved, that the 2022 NBA-SPIDEL Annual Conference be postponed not only for the safety of our conferees and guests, but as a mark of respect for the memory of the slain Miss Deborah Yakubu,” the NBA President said.
