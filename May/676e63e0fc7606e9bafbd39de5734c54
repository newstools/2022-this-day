HighLife  Death has a way of unhinging the mind. It can upend everything bright and gay about an individual, including ambitions, and turn it all into grey stuff and ashes. It takes a strong heart to throw all of death’s shades back at it and forge on. This is what the lawmaker representing Oyo Central Senatorial District in the Senate, Senator Teslim Folarin, has done. Barely four months after he lost his wife to death, Folarin has turned his eyes back to life and is intent on making the most of it. In January 2022, quite a number of prominent individuals passed on. One of these was his wife, Angela.  Although not much was published about the cause of death, except that the late wife, mother, sister, traditional Chief, and barrister died in the United Kingdom, those she left behind felt her passing strongly. This includes her dear husband, the political figure, Folarin. Many people assumed that Folarin would continue to mourn the passing of his wife and thereby lose his edge in the deep political waters of Oyo. After all, he is one of the ‘undertakers’ of politics in the state who serve to remind others politics is not for the faint of heart. However, very few people could have imagined that Folarin would be back to himself, that is, an aggressive politician going for the jugular of his opponents, so soon. This time Folarin has upended the table of expectations by declaring his intention to run for Oyo governorship under the auspices of the All Progressives Congress. In other words, Folarin will be going against fellow political undertakers, especially Adebayo Adelabu who is also after the seat of Governor Seyi Makinde. So, for those wondering how one gets over death, Folarin is a good reference.
