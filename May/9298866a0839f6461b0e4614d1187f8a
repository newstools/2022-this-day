HighLife  Being a public figure and being susceptible to controversies are not mutually exclusive. For some of the most prominent political figures in Nigeria, being in the eye of the storm is an everyday affair. The routine is simple: mistakenly fall into the storm, get out, lay low for a while until it all blows over, and get back into the limelight. Unfortunately for Senator and former Minister of Aviation, Stella Oduah, the process is taking too long. To make it even worse, she appears to be stuck at the ‘mistakenly fall into the storm’ stage. Social media has been roused once again to the person of Oduah, former Aviation Minister with controversies trailing behind her. This time, it is not a matter of indebtedness, forged academic certification, or misappropriation of funds. Instead, it is the justice system refusing to hurry things up and allow Oduah the time to rest, get out, lay low for a while until it all blows over, and get back into the limelight. A Federal High Court in Abuja has reportedly restricted the proceedings of Oduah’s fraud case. Reports on this front state that Oduah was in court a few days ago with several others. The court was supposed to fiddle around with papers and figures, and come to a conclusion about the alleged N7.9 billion money laundering charges levelled against Oduah. But things did not go like this. The court, for one reason or the other, could not conclude when to begin the proceedings that would see Oduah exonerated or penalised. Before, Oduah reportedly made a point to hide away from the law and the courtroom. However, now that she is present, she is being told to return home and come to court to fight another day. The entire thing can set one on edge, so a few people sympathise with Oduah. After all, this is the fifth time the case is being forced to sit on the bench for a while. In fact, it is very unlikely that Oduah is having the time of her life right now.
