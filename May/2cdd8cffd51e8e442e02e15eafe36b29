Speaking,   Okunnu-Lamidi said: “This upcoming election is a redefining moment for our dear country, the message of hope and belief is what every Nigerian is holding onto at this moment. The time to turn things around is now. The mandate given to me by the people is what drives me, we are so proud of our progress so far. Becoming the flag bearer of the SDP to contest for the presidency of Nigeria is the next stage so help me God,” said Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi. The 38-year old Okunnu-Lamidi explained that she is  part of Nigeria’s teeming youth majority demographic who believe in the hope and promise of a better Nigeria guaranteed by the ability and capacity of its youth population that demand now more than ever before to be part of the process of governance that defines their lives today and in the future.
