 Sylvester Idowu in Warri The Niger Delta Congress (NDC) has called on the federal government to urgently hold a national dialogue before the 2023 general election. The group said the call became necessary following growing disaffection being exhibited by various bodies across the country and the state of insecurity facing the country at present. NDC in a statement signed by its National President, Nubari Sataah, urged the federal government and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to postpone all activities leading to the 2023 general election immediately. The group maintained that the elections should only hold after a national dialogue is held to determine the unity of the country with a truly people-crafted constitution as the basis. The group had on April 23, 2022, unveiled the Niger Delta Peoples Charter in Warri, Delta State, as part of its strategies to actualise self-determination and resource control. It vowed to begin enforcement of the charter after series of town hall meetings held across the oil and gas-rich Niger Delta region. The group expressed anger that none of the bills so far passed by the National Assembly captured the critical issue of resource control despite NDC’s  recommendations to that effect in the ongoing constitutional review.
