Afro-fusion and RnB artist, Olayinka Okoya Fofah aka Pandamonae releases his new single “FALL”Fall” is the second single off Pandamonae’s upcoming project, Dawn & Dusk. His first EP, the project is an introduction into Panda’s universe- yin and yang, day and night, a world where everything exists plainly in its most natural state. Produced by Rewardbeatz who produced one of the biggest songs in Nigeria in 2022(Buga), Fall is a descriptive afro EDM infused track that explores the daily life of a hustler and how a mother’s prayer keeps the hope alive. The song starts with a very on brand sound which is the ‘Ruan’ (Chinese guitar) being that Pandas come from central china. Pandamonae’s energetic baritone voice merges with the beat perfectly, with a memorable hook that can best be described as self-assuring and optimistic, featuring orations from the artist that oozes confidence that leave a strong and lasting impression on the listener.
