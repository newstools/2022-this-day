 Emma Okonji Jumia recently released its first Environmental Social Governance (ESG) Report, outlining its strategy alongside an overview of current sustainability practices at Jumia. The report draws on Jumia’s 2021 non-financial data and provides disclosures in line with Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) materiality topics for e-commerce entities as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). While recognising the importance of standard ESG focus areas, Jumia draws attention to the unique role that e-commerce plays in advancing more equal opportunities in Africa. As such the company has made its mission, “Leveraging technology to improve everyday lives in Africa,” the first pillar of its sustainability strategy. The report highlights five material themes in the context of its sustainability strategy to include: Minimising Impact on Environment; Providing Convenience, Affordability and Accessibility for Consumers; Empowering sellers, partners, and communities; Building an engaged inclusive and diverse workforce; Operating with Strong Governance and Ethical Standards. Jumia Co-founders and CEOs, Sacha Poignonnec and Jeremy Hodara, said: “We are proud that through our actions and our ecosystem we are contributing to social development, generating employment and business opportunities, and closing inequality gaps for thousands of people.” Giving details of the sustainability report, Jumia Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairwoman Nigeria, Juliet Anammah, said: “It is exciting to note that we have endless opportunities to make choices which are good for our business and also good for our people, communities and the planet. As a growing entity on the path to profitability, this alignment between sustainability and our business objectives is a critical success factor.” According to her, Jumia has always operated on a robust architecture, and did not experience any data breach in its operation between 2020 and 2021, which the sustainability report covers.
