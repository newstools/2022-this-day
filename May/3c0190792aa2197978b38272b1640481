 Francis Sardauna A Presidential aspirant on the Platform of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Bala Mohammed, has described Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari as a failed state by all standards of judgment. He explained that the recurrent cases of insurgency, banditry and poverty have become worrisome in the country under the watch of President Buhari, whom he described as a northern leader. Mohammed, who is the current Governor of Bauchi State, added that President Buhari and APC leaders in the north had failed woefully in tackling the security and economic challenges besetting northerners. Addressing delegates and leaders of PDP in Katsina ahead of the party’s primaries, Mohammed said that Buhari did not understand politics and failed to live up to expectation because he is surrounded by “liars and sycophants.” “The people of Katsina State have done great things for the development of this country, an example is what late President Umaru Musa Yar’adua has done for Nigeria, May Allah repose his soul. “But your son, our father, the current president, is surrounded by dishonest people, liars whom he thought are people of integrity, because he is a soldier, he doesn’t know people or politics. “We know everybody, both good and bad ones, we must correct that bad impression that we are all bad people, we must secure the future for our children and grandchildren, and we need dogged people like me,” he said. He, however, said if he becomes the President in 2023, he would address the challenges of poverty, economic meltdown, and insecurity and restore the country’s lost glory for the citizens.
