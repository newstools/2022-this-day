 Alex Enumah in Abuja Justice Inyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court, Abuja on Monday adjourned to Tuesday to entertain the bail application of former Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha.The judge fixed the date after the senator representing Imo senatorial district was arraigned before him on corruption charges.The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had arraigned Okorocha on a 17-count charge bordering on alleged diversion of the sum of N2.9 billion belonging to the state government.According to the charge, Okorocha had diverted the funds from the Imo State Government House Accounts and that of the Imo State Local Government Joint accounts to private companies.The alleged fraud was said to have been perpetrated by Okorocha and one Anyim Inyerere with the use of their private companies between 2014 and 2016 when he held sway as the governor of Imo State.He however denied all the charges preferred against him by the EFCC.Following his not-guilty plea, EFCC counsel, Gbolahan Latona, asked the judge for an adjournment to enable him assemble his witnesses that will testify in the case.According Latona, the commission has listed 15 witnesses to testify against the APC presidential aspirant.He added that most of the witnesses are outside the court jurisdiction because of the peculiar nature of the charge.Responding, Okorocha’s counsel, Okey Amaechi, told the court that he had filed an application for Okorocha’s bail and had also served same on EFCC.He attempted to argue the application but was opposed by the anti-graft agency which claimed that it intends to file a counter affidavit against the bail issued.Although, the EFCC’S lawyer sought adjournment to June 1 for arguments on bail, Justice Ekwo ruled that he would take all the bail applications on May 31 and directed EFCC to endeavour to  file its opposition within time.Justice Inyang Ekwo subsequently ordered Okorocha’s further detention with the EFCC till May 31 when his bail application would be argued.
