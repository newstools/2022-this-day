* Jettisons Plateau south senatorial ambition Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Paullen Tallen, has chickened out of her plan to resign from the cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari to pursue her political ambition in her home state, Plateau.Like her two other colleagues namely Abubakar Malami (Justice) and Chris Ngige (Labour and Productivity), she has decided to remain as minister and beat the May 16, 2022 deadline given ministers in President Buhari’s cabinet with political ambition to resign.Tallen, who along with eight of her colleagues last Friday, attended a valedictory session with the president at the State House in Abuja, in a statement on Monday personally signed by her, said her resigning from the Federal Executive Council (FEC) will be a contravention of Article 31 of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Constitution which gave political office holders 30 days to resign before party primary or election.According to the minister, “Mindful that the Constitution of APC stipulates in Article 31 (1) (iii) (October 2014 As Amended),  that: ‘Any party office holder interested in contesting for an elective office (whether party office or office in a general election) shall resign and leave office 30 days prior to the date of nomination or party primary for the office he or she is seeking to contest aspiring to any office must have resigned his/her appointment days’. It will therefore be a breach to resign office at this time since this was not done ahead of the stipulated timeline.”The former Deputy Governor of Plateau State also said she has for now jettison her ambition to run for a senatorial seat in Plateau South in the 2023 general election.Rather, she asked her teeming supporters to re-elect the current senator representing Plateau South, who is also a female, Prof. Nora Daduut.Tallen, in the press release stated, inter alia: “I stand here today thankful to God for His abiding faith in my life and for the multiple opportunities for me to serve this country in various capacities, humbled by the love, support and commitment shown me by well-meaning Nigerians, with the intent for the good of the great people of the Southern Senatorial District of Plateau State.“Mindful of the task before us, I am deeply grateful for the trust vested in me as we all strive to make meaningful contributions for the greater good of our country as a whole. “Women groups and other stakeholders had thought it wise to purchase an expression of interest form under the APC for me to participate in the forthcoming elections.  I would like to thank and assure all my supporters that while their intention was well conceived, my current work in superintending the numerous projects for Mr President as Women Affairs Minister require my undivided attention. “Additionaly, whilst their quest is a good move in support of the clamour for more women in elective and appointive positions, and considered to be critical in addressing the gender question, I am compelled to focus on the foundations we have laid towards the advancement and realisation of gender equality in leadership positions in the country.“I wish to thank Mr. President for his commitment  to the advancement of  Nigerian women and his acclaimed promise to support and spotlight the importance of women in our society. Our nation has a long standing commitment in overcoming the challenges that inhibit  women from bringing about positive changes and the requisite impacts when given a place at the table of decision making. My appointment as the Minister of Women Affairs is indicative of this progress and I cannot lose sight of this opportunity.” She said her quest for gender equality and broadening access to enable women to participate meaningfully in nation building, is at the heart of her desire to unlock the potentials of women to bring about positive change in the history of Nigeria. Tallen stated that the instruments with which she aims to bring about these changes might be new but the values upon which the success rests is most critical, if appreciable, progress is to be made in fulfilling the well conceived gender agenda. The minister said she remains resolute as she continues to relish the opportunity to serve Nigerian women in her capacity as Minister of Women Affairs under the able leadership of President Buhari, adding that wishes to inform Nigerians that following broadbased consultations and interventions from critical stakeholders, she has decided to withdraw from running for the senatorial seat mindful of her accomplishments and the notable progress she has recorded under her stewardship at the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs.
