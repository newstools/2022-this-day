AON’s spokesman and Chairman of United Nigeria Airlines, Obiora Okonkwo, said this in a statement yesterday. According to Okonkwo, the persistent fuel scarcity was affecting the operations of air transport in the country and could lead to more rescheduling and cancellations of flights. He, however, said the AON was working in alliance with product marketers, government and relevant stakeholders to ensure availability and proper pricing of the product in the country. “The Airline Operators of Nigeria wish to alert the public of impending disruptions to scheduled flight operations of members of the association. This development is being forced on members by the growing scarcity of aviation fuel popular as Jet-Al. “The scarcity is impacting negatively on the seamless conduct of air transport operations and would lead to flight rescheduling, and, or, cancellations. “While pleading the understanding of the flying public in the face of this reality, we also promise to do all that is necessary, and within our powers, to restore normal flight schedules as soon as possible,” he said. However, the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika at the opening of the 7th African Indian Ocean Region (AFI) Aviation Week in Abuja, yesterday, said petroleum products scarcity had become a global challenge because of the Russian-Ukraine war, noting that there is scarcity of the products in different parts of the world.
