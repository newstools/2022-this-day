By Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi Irate youths believed to be religious fanatics late Friday evening went on rampage destroying structures belonging to Christians in Katangan Warji, headquarters of Warji LGA of Bauchi State. THISDAY checks revealed that trouble started when unconfirmed reports circulated in the social media that one of the Christian youths in the town allegedly blasphemed against Islam.This is coming a week after a Sokoto student  Deborah Yakubu was killed by Islamic fanatics over alleged blasphemy. Our source who pleaded anonymity stated that, “We were at home Friday evening when we heard shouts from Muslim youths in their hundreds wanting to attack the ECWA church but Christian youths and others resisted and repelled them but after they had already set the shops attached to the Church on fire.”According to him, “In the process, one of the Pastors of the ECWA Church was seriously wounded. I am speaking to you, efforts are on to save his life as blood is rushing from the wounds inflicted on him”. Another source told our Correspondent that it was one of youths who recently converted from Christianity to Islam who allegedly raised the alarm of the alleged blasphemy by a Christian lady and led other Muslim youths in search of her. One of the leaders of the Christian Association of Nigeria in the state confirmed the situation and said the Police Commissioner in the state and the SSA to the Governor on Christian Religious Affairs, had been informed.He called on the Christian community in the state not to allow the situation to degenarate even though they had to protect themselves from the attackers, assuring that security operatives will do everything possible to safeguard lives and property. All efforts to get confirmation of the situation officially from the State Police Command failed as the PPRO, SP Ahmed Wakili neither picked up the phone when his number was called severally nor replied messages sent to his mobile phone.
