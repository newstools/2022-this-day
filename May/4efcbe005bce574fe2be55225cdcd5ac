HighLife Political power is a very delicate thing. If not treated cautiously, this power can render everything else to ashes and disperse them to the wind. Thus, it takes strong and determined individuals to handle political power appropriately. This is one of the praises being submitted at the feet of Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun as he clocks 62 years and three years in office. Many individuals have taken charge of Ogun as governor, but only a few have managed to do so with finesse. Governor Abiodun has shown himself to be a gracious and considerate leader of the people. There is no other explanation for the deluge of birthday wishes and encomiums that the people have sent his way. Moreover, as it is a double celebration for the progress-minded governor, the entire state is celebrating his achievements. Governor Abiodun was born on May 29, 1960. He was also sworn in as Governor of Ogun on May 29, 2019. Although there is a 59-year gap between both dates, some say that Abiodun has managed to fill this gap with many good things in his three years as the state’s governor. Abiodun was able to bag Vanguard’s Governor of the Year Award in 2021 for a reason. The man had taken seriously – and continues to take seriously – his ambition to develop five areas in Ogun. These areas are infrastructural development, social welfare and wellbeing, education and human capital development, youth empowerment, and agriculture and food security. He labelled this ISEYA. In the past three years, Abiodun has indeed developed these areas significantly. Thus, the state-wide excitement over the double celebration of Abiodun’s 62nd birthday and third year in office is not without reason. Great men are indeed worth celebrating.
