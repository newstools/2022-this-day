 Deji Elumoye in Abuja Top officials of the Presidency Saturday evening disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari was yet to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill passed recently by the National Assembly.This is contrary to reports in some quarters especially online platforms which had on Saturday been awashed with claims that the President had already signed the bill, which was transmitted to him last week Friday. More than one official sources had written off the report as untrue, saying the bill could not have been signed in secret, especially with the fact that the President had been out of the country in the last 48 hours and just returned to the country on Saturday evening. Commenting on the issue, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, who just returned to the country with the President, said the news of the signing, was not to his knowledge, saying “it is news to me too”. Speaking in the same vein, Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (House of Representatives), Hon Umar El-Yakub, said the viral news could not be true, citing logistic reasons for his conclusion.According to him, “the President couldn’t have signed it yesterday because he was out of the country and he couldn’t have signed already because he’s just entering the country.“I also cannot tell you that he will still sign it or will not sign it. He’s the President. But if it will be signed later, we will all know”, he said.
