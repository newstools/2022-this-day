 Laleye Dipo in Minna Two House of Representatives aspirants for Chanchaga federal constituency of Niger State, Dr. Mustapha Jibrin, and Mr. Ahmed Nma, have petitioned the electoral committee and the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the alleged use of fake delegates list for the conduct of the primaries last Friday The duo, through their campaign organisation, the Unity Mega Group in Niger State, claimed that there was no primary election held to pick a standard bearer for the APC in Chanchaga Local Government Area. In the petition signed on their behalf by the Chairman of the group Mr. Saidu Magaji, they want the national chairman of “our great party and the world to know that there was no primary election in Chanchaga LGA for fear that a particular candidate will win the election.” According to the petitioners, “On May 27, delegates and party faithful were at the venue of the primary election from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. for the election, but no election was conducted,” before calling on the national chairman of the party to “address the issue with immediate effect and direct the state party executives to obey the wishes of the masses for smooth running of the 2023 general election.” He warned that if the issue was not addressed, the two aspirants would be forced to move to another party to contest, and would be voted for by the masses in the election. The document assured the public that “those who want to become self-assumed kingmakers in the state and Chanchaga will be disappointed by the masses at the general election.” The petitioners also called on the governorship candidate of the party for next year’s election, Mr. Umar Mohammed Bago, to intervene in the impasse which has the capacity of affecting his (Bago) victory in the election if not resolved.
