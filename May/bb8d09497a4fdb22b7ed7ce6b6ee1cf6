HighLife In the Biblical account of history, there were representatives of God who figuratively belched out fire whenever they wanted to change things. Someone said that these people were a kind of social entrepreneurs, except that their methods were tribulative. Even though such prophets do not dwell among us today, we have those that continue to make things happen in the name of the Most High God. Have you met Pastor Tunde Bakare, the man who works the pulpit with as much gusto as in Nigeria’s political space? If you know Pastor Bakare, you will know that some of the men of God that we have today breathe fire in their own unique ways. Bakare is an outspoken public figure, with the Good Book in his left hand and a rod of correction in his right. He is not one to shy away from discourse, be it social, economic, or political. So it came as no surprise that he intends to run for president under no canopy but that of the All Progressives Congress (APC)? What is Pastor Bakare’s agenda? The clergyman has declared this himself: peace, progress, prosperity and possibilities. With each of these elements, Bakare hopes to pull Nigeria out of the darkness of mediocrity, stagnation in some areas, and full-on relegation in others. Bakare’s path is blazing and that is primarily because he is coming from a religious angle without apologies. Whether this is enough to get him out of the ‘Presidential Hopeful’ or ‘aspirant’ status and into the title of ‘Presidential Candidate’ is something else entirely. One thing is for sure, and that is that regardless of the results of his campaign, Bakare will shine in the limelight for a long time.
