 Ibrahim Shuaibu A candidate for Kano Central Senatorial District in All Progressives Congress (APC), Abdulsalam Abdulkarim Zaura, has boasted that he will defeat a serving Senator, representing the zone in the senatorial Ibrahim Shekarau in 2023 election and retire him and former Kano State governor, Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso in politics. Zaura said he is not threatened by the political merger of the two political giants in the state. Speaking to  journalists in Kano, Zaura said the 2023 senatorial election would be the time he would send Kwankwaso and Shekarau parking and retire them in politics. According to him, the time of Kwankwaso and Shekarau  in politics is up, urging them to leave it to youths, who are coming up to dominate. “Kwankwaso and Shekarau, the two former governors and senators. I think their time is up. Everything has its own time. This is our time. “In the general contest, we will send them packing. We will send them to rest. It is a very good time for them to rest. If we go there, we can do better, in fact, we will do better “I respect all of them. They are my fathers, but I think it is time for them to rest from  politics,” Zaura said. He, however, said his opponents, including those within APC, had engaged in campaigns of calumny against him, expressing gratitude that “in the end, I have succeeded.” “To God be the glory. Despite what they did to me, I am extending my hands of cooperation to them that they should come and join the winning train because ours is the winning team God willing. “Let them come and join hands for the success of our great party, the APC,” he added.
