 Fidelis David in Akure An aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Owo/Ose federal constituency seat in the House of Representatives, Dr. Abiola Oshodi, yesterday alleged that there was no delegate election in the two local government areas of Ondo State. The Canada-based Nigerian doctor and Associate Professor, who accused his opponents in the race to hijack the processes, called on the state Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), to intervene in the election processes. Oshodi, who spoke in a statement made available to journalists in Akure by the spokesman of his campaign organisation, Aliyu Hussein Taye, said  party members who thronged the venues of the congresses in Owo/Ose federal constituency were disappointed as the election did not hold, lamenting that the action was against the dictates of the national leadership of the APC. The statement read: “They are writing the lists in their hideouts. This action in indicative that under a normal democratic process, they are aware they will lose the election. We want to advise these undemocratic elements to stop dragging the good name of our revered governor in the murky waters of desperate politicking. “Anything that will pitch the party against its members must be avoided at all cost. Our understanding of democracy is not the one in which an individual or group of individuals must force their wills on the people. The democracy we know is the one that allows the majority of party members to decide who represent them. “The party is being alerted that the process to conduct a free, fair and credible primary election in Owo/Ose federal constituency is about to be  scuttled. It is time party leadership rose to defend and uphold their promises.” Reacting, the state Chairman of the party, Ade Adetimehin, said delegates were elected through consensus in many wards and local government areas. He said elections were held in areas where the contenders fail to reach a consensus.
