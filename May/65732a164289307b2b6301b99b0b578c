 Winners have emerged in the second edition of Mobo Game Jam, a global game-making competition organised by Kucheza Gaming in partnership with edu360, Union Bank’s education platform. The competition which encourages young innovators (heroes) between the ages of 8-18, brought together participants from Nigeria and the UK to compete and develop video games or game prototypes that combine creativity, compassion, and computational thinking to defeat a villain causing a global problem, and by so doing raise awareness and provide possible solutions for that problem. Speaking at the ceremony, Ngozi Akinyele Head, Strategic Brand Management Union Bank shared the reason behind edu360’s decision to partner with Kucheza Gaming for the second edition of Mobo Game Jam. She said: “At edu360 our goal is to prepare our future leaders for the realities of an increasingly digitized world.  We believe education should be a holistic 360 learning experience that extends well beyond the walls of a classroom and this partnership helps amplify our goal. Through the Game Jam, we are creating awareness about social issues and working with young people to proffer solutions. edu360 remains focused on fostering collaborations and partnerships like this that boost the development of the Nigerian education sector and provide access to quality learning outcomes for Nigerian children and youth.” Also speaking at the event, the founder of Kucheza Gaming, Bukola Akingbade, noted that games have the power to inspire change. According to her, there is a huge opportunity available at the intersection of video games and education that can build a sustainable future for children. “We must ask the question, ‘what do kids need for their future? By taking a considered approach, we believe video games and the disparate opportunities within the industry, can help retain young people’s attention, while simultaneously utilising the tool for skill acquisition to build a better future,” Akingbade said.
