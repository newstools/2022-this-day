 The Chairman, Governing Council, Association of Securities Dealing Hoises of Nigeria (ASHON), Mr Sam Onukwue, has explained that the Association rebranded to cope with the demands, arising from changing dynamics of the global financial market, and the need to cope with the new demands of customers. Prior to the demutualisation of The Nigerian Stock Exchange (now NGX), ASHON has embarked on rebranding; including transformation of its processes to serve its diverse customers better and urged its members to review their business models for global competitiveness. The Association also extended the transformation to some brand attributes such as changing its name from Association of Stockbroking Houses of Nigeria to that of Securities Dealing Houses and also changed the logo  to reflect the enlarged functions of its members. Last week, ASHON organised a strategic training programme for its Staff in the Secretariat, themed “Developing Employee for sustainable value creation in an organization ” to upskill them for optimal performance in the new operating environment. Addressing the participants, Onukwue, explained that every organisation should review its business models, train staff and expose them to modern tools in  Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for enhanced performance. Onukwue noted that as an Association whose members comprise top flight professionals in the financial market, the need for rebranding was imperative and the goals could not be achieved without the support of our Staff. According to him, ASHON has always been at the forefront of ensuring that its members operate professionally while the Association collaborates with the capital market regulators, operators and other members in the ecosystem. Onukwue stated that ASHON had always played pivotal roles in  policies that impacted the capital market, including banks’ recapitalization, demutualsation of The Exchange among others.
