 Fidelis David in Akure Students of three different universities in Ondo State yesterday blocked the Ilesha/ Akure expressway in protest over the prolonged strike  by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in the country. The students are from the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA), Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA), and Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa (OAUSTECH). The students barricaded the road to vent their anger over their continued stay at home, forcing many motorists and travellers to be stranded. They blocked the main entrance of the institution, road junction and FUTA junction, with Disc Jockey (DJ) playing music. They were seen chanting different solidarity songs and displayed placards with various inscriptions. However, efforts to speak with leaders of the protesters proved abortive as they said they were not ready to address journalists. Meanwhile, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force, Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) and Ondo State Security Network Agency codenamed Amotekun Corps were on ground to maintain peace and order.
