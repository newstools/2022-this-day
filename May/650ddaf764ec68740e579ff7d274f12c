By Vanessa Obioha Ibadan-born businessman and pub­lisher of Ireland-based journal, The Street Journal Magazine, Mogaji Arisekola has stated reasons he is supporting the ambition of the National leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and frontline presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu to become Nigeria’s next President.He told some selected senior journalists at his Abuja office on Friday that Tinubu had got what it takes to provide the quality and desirable leadership Nigeria needs at a time like this.“Those who know me will attest to the fact that I am ever loyal to my friends, loyal to a political cause I believe in and on no account will I compromise my moral rectitude. That is who I am and nothing can change that. I am making a bold statement today that my unalloyed support for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Presidential ambition is 100% and I can assure you that he is going to emerge as President Buhari’s successor in 2023 through the merit and strength of the ballot.”Continuing, he said the former Lagos Governor brought innovations into the governance of the state during his eight years in power.“I can assure anyone who cares to listen that he will replicate similar feats when he eventually becomes Nigeria’s President. I have not denied him of my support and I have not pretended about my open support for him either.“My father-son’s relationship with Tinubu is not in contention and is something I never pretended about and even several of those who are contesting from the South-West also have their own relationships with him as well.“This is because he had been there for a lot of us in the past and he is still there. He has the clout, mien, the charisma, velvety and suave dispositions that the number one office deserves. Asiwaju is simply the best man for the job. I believe both on moral ground as well as out of conviction that he has got what it takes to provide the kind of quality leadership this country needs at a precarious moment like this.”Recalling the number of presidential aspirants from the APC, Arisekola acknowledged their political ambition but maintained that the office is for competent hands with requisite experience and qualifications. “It is not meant for a neophyte. But I believe that part of the essence of democracy is that there will be constructive engagement.”Arisekola added that Tinubu is not a greenhorn in politics and that he is a committed and patriotic party man, a consummate professional, a respected nationalist, a trailblazer, a committed philanthropist and a true family man who can proactively restore the fortunes of Nigeria socio-economically without bias or lapses.
