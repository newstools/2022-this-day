 David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The wife of the immediate-past Governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano, Mrs. Ebelechukwu Obiano, has won the ticket of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to contest for the Senate. Mrs. Obiano wants to represent the people of Anambra North senatorial zone in the National Assembly. She beat Mr. Primus Odili, who was her husband’s Chief of Staff, during his tenure as governor at the keenly contested primary election held at Chuba Ikpeazu Township Stadium in Onitsha. Result released by the election committee showed that Mrs. Obiano, who is popularly known as Osodieme, scored 152 votes, while Odili scored 120 votes. Two other aspirants, Mr. Junior Onwuteaka and Mr. Tony Nnacheta, scored two votes each. Violence had erupted at Otuocha Stadium in Anambra East Local Government Area last Saturday at the venue of the election, forcing the committee to move it to yesterday. Mrs. Obiano has been having a tough challenge over her aspiration, as two persons, said to have been made by her husband, had ganged up to stop her from picking the ticket. The former governor’s wife will now square up with Princess Stella Oduah, a former minister of Aviation, and the current senator of the zone in the general election next year.
