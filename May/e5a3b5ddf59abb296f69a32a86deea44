 Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City The Edo State Police Command has ordered a thorough investigation into the barbaric and dehumanising act of jungle justice meted on an alleged suspect by some irate youths in Auchi, headquarters of Etasako West Local Government Area. The Commissioner of Police, Mr. Abutu Yaro gave the directive in a statement the command’s spokesman, Kintongs Bello issued yesterday, frowning at the jungle justice while reacting to the ugly incident. The suspect, according to Investigation, was accused of theft and subsequently set ablaze by the mob, who arrested the victim as members of the vigilante group in the locality. The statement said the police commissioner frowned at the action of the vigilantes, who instead of taking the suspect to the police for proper investigation and prosecution, aided the irate mob to burn the suspect to death for allegedly stealing without any recourse to the law. It said: “CP Abutu Yaro, who described the act as barbaric and inimical to the law governing our dear country, warned the indigenes of Edo State that the command under his watch will not allow disgruntled elements in the society to take laws into their hands by killing suspects arrested for alleged crimes in such a dehumanising and unlawful manner. “He further warned that nobody has the right to treat suspects in such a barbaric manner; and it is wrong for anyone to assume the position of a law enforcement agency. “That suspects apprehended in connection with any crime should be immediately handed over to the police or any law enforcement agency constitutionally saddled with the responsibility of investigating and prosecuting such suspects. “The police commissioner appealed to the general public to be calm, as the police command is already mopping up those responsible for this gruesome act for possible prosecution,” the statement said.
