 Francis Sardauna in Katsina President Muhammudu Buhari’s nephew and member representing Daura/Sandamu/Mai’Adua Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon. Fatuhu Muhammed, has petitioned the All Progressives Congress (APC) over alleged replacement of delegates’ list and irregularities in the constituency. He alleged that some APC stalwarts within the constituency fraudulently forged the delegates list of last Friday’s House of Representatives primary election in the area to favour their anointed candidate. The lawmaker, while addressing journalists in Daura, described the action of the APC chieftains as a national embarrassment to the ruling party and vowed to take lawful measures to seek redress within the constitutional provisions of the party. Muhammed, who was among the six APC aspirants that contested for the primary election, was defeated by Aminu Jamo, who scored 117 votes, according to the result announced by Bala Zango, the returning officer for the election. He said: “What happened on Friday is a huge embarrassment to the growth of the APC, because even if such things will happen in APC, it should not be in the constituency of President Muhammadu Buhari. “Some selfish individuals within the party changed the list of delegates that have been legally confirmed to suit their selfishness and not to the entirety of the constituency. “I have submitted a petition to the APC national petition committee. I will give them time to see if justice will be done to me, and if justice is not done to me, I will sit with my supporters within the three local governments to make another decision.”
