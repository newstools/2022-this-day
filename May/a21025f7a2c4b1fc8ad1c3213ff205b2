 Seriki Adinoyi in Jos Former Governor of Plateau State, Jonah Jang, has charged gubernatorial aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to put their acts together and push out the government of the All Progressive Congress (APC) that has taken the state backward in the past seven years. Jang gave the charge while congratulating the winner of the PDP governorship ticket in the state, Mr. Caleb Mutfwang, who was declared winner after he polled 252 votes to defeat other contestants at the primary election. Hailing the peaceful conduct of the exercise, Jang said it was conducted under a free and fair atmosphere without any kind of rancor, adding that it was a sign of good things soon to be experienced in the state. In a statement by his Media Consultant, Mr. Clinton Garuba, Jang said, “The outcome of the primaries will best be described as no victor no vanquished, as all the aspirants gave a good account of themselves, and congratulated each other for a good contest.
