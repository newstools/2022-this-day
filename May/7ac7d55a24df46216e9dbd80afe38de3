 Roland defending champion Novak Djokovic produced another outstanding display as he reached the French Open fourth round without having dropped a set all week. Serbia’s Djokovic, 34, won 6-3 6-3 6-2 – saving one break point in the third set – against Slovenia’s Aljaz Bedene. The top seed remains on course for a potential quarter-final meeting with Spain’s 13-time champion Rafael Nadal. Nadal, 35, also moved into the last 16 yesterday with a 6-3 6-2 6-4 win over Dutch opponent Botic van de Zandschulp. Nadal, who was beaten by Djokovic in a gripping semi-final last year, will face Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime in Paris on Sunday. An intriguing element to that match is Toni Nadal – Rafael’s uncle, who coached him to 16 of his 21 major titles – is part of Auger-Aliassime’s team in Paris. Ninth seed Auger-Aliassime earned his spot in the last 16 with a 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-2) 7-5 win against Serbia’s Filip Krajinovic. Nadal secured his victory over 26th seed Van de Zandschulp when he saw off a break point before serving out the win. Standing between Djokovic and the possibility of a 59th career meeting with Nadal is Argentine 15th seed Diego Schwartzman, his last-16 opponent.
