HighLife  Are great leaders born from the human womb or are they deliberately created to act in perilous times? This is a debate that has gone on for too long, but not without reason. With celebrated individuals like Abike Dabiri-Erewa in the same leadership ring as some of her lesser-known peers, one can only wonder how it came to be that some people’s talents and merits are incomparable while others are as common as possible. As Dabiri-Erewa prepares to celebrate her 60th birthday, her peculiar characteristics and career profile are being printed everywhere for all to see and emulate. There aren’t a lot of Nigerian public figures that have managed to dazzle our countrymen within and outside the borders of the nation. Dabiri-Erewa is one of the political characters that have managed to succeed in this endeavour. Since she came into the limelight during her NTA (Nigerian Television Authority) years until now, Dabiri-Erewa’s grace has remained particularly special. They say that lionesses are just fiercer lions. This is true for Dabiri-Erewa. This side of her is well-known to every foreign dignitary who has had to interact with her as the Chairman/CEO of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM). Yet, despite her fierceness and refusal to back down in the face of injustice, Dabiri-Erewa is a sweet soul. Only a handful of sweet souls like her are occupying political positions in the country presently. At 60, Dabiri-Erewa will remain one of the most supportive characters for Nigerians in the diaspora. Furthermore, her ever-present promotion of the welfare of Nigerians does not only extend to those abroad. How many famed Nigerians in Nigeria have had their banners raised by the Amazon? Endless list, if one may say so. Truly, Dabiri-Erewa is an inspiration to many people, young and old, male or female. Her life of 60 long and impactful years indicates that great leaders are both born and trained to rise to the occasion of injustice and national stagnation.
