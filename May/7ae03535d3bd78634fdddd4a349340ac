Society Watch  On Saturday, April 23, 2022, Hajia Habiba Abubakar, a prominent businesswoman, passed on, thereby throwing her family and loved ones in grief. Following her passing, the hearts of her family and friends have been indescribably heavy,  just as tears have ceaselessly cascaded down their faces. They are, however,  comforted by the fact that she lived a fulfilled life and impacted humanity positively. It is a fact that the deceased succeeded in a male-dominated milieu, as she invested heavily in the hospitality business in her hometown, Kano. As proof of her success story in the hospitality industry, she was working on a project that had reached an advanced stage before she passed on. She left behind her husband, Amb. Abdullahi Abubakar, and three children — Khaleed, Khadijah and Nabil. In life, she was reputed for her great philanthropic deeds, which endeared her to the common people, especially the physically challenged and the elderly, in Abuja and parts of the North. It was no surprise that she received awards for her humane gestures. Besides the awards she received in Nigeria, the light-skinned woman was also honoured in Holland and some other countries for her humanitarian activities. Her Non-Government Organisation (NGO), the Foundation for the Elderly and the Poor, founded in 2006, transcends national, ethnic and religious borders.
