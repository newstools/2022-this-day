 Some of Africa’s great talents and international football stars were featured in the Draw The Line Against Malaria campaign. The campaign is a partnership between Paramount Africa youth channel brands, MTV Base and BET Africa and Zero Malaria Starts With Me movement. The partnership strives to boost malaria awareness, promote education, and engage youth in the fight to end Malaria. The stellar cast of the multi-award-winning Draw the Line Against Malaria campaign includes Malaria No More UK Leadership Council founding member David Beckham, FC Barcelona striker Pierre Emerick Aubameyang, marathon world record-holder Eliud Kipchoge, double gold Olympian Faith Kipchoge, Pan African TV presenter Bonang Matheba, and Afropop singer Yemi Alade. The fast-paced new Draw The Line film, created by Black Dog Films and directed by Meji Alabi, builds on the ground-breaking momentum of the first phase of the campaign, delivering an urgent message highlighting the malaria crisis while encouraging leaders that with the right arsenal of tools, strong funding commitments, and renewed political will, this is a fight we can win. It was aired on the channels and also part of the MTV Base Africa Day concert held yesterday, May 28. “As the official broadcast partner, Paramount Africa is proud to amplify, drive social change and inspire young people and world leaders across Africa, and globally, to prioritise efforts towards the fight against malaria,” said Senior Vice President and General Manager of Paramount Africa, Monde Twala. A special broadcast of the Africa Day celebrations will air on MTV Base, on Saturday, June 11.
