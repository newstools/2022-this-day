Andy Murray began his build-up to Wimbledon with a routine straight-set win over Austria’s Jurij Rodionov in the first round of the Surbiton Trophy. Former world number one Murray, 35, triumphed 6-2 6-1 in just 57 minutes. The three-time Grand Slam winner broke Rodionov’s serve twice in each set to comfortably beat the world number 125. Murray elected to skip the French Open and instead enter the ATP Challenger Tour event in London to concentrate on the grass-court season. He had not played since withdrawing from a third-round match with Novak Djokovic because of illness at the Madrid Open at the start of May. But despite a rain delay pushing his match back to late afternoon, Murray, currently ranked 67th in the world, had little trouble despatching Rodionov. Liam Broady is scheduled to face Jay Clarke later on Monday in an all-British affair while Heather Watson, Harriet Dart and Katie Boulter all feature in the women’s event.
