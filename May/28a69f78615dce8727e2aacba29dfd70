The Foundation’s commitment is to redirect and groom the youths in rural communities who were about to be overtaken by social vices like drug abuse, kidnapping, rape, and cultism. Speaking on the next phases for the Foundation, the CEO Mrs. Carole Emeka Sunday said, “to start with, we conducted a need assessment in Igando community, Alimosho L.G.A, and observed the challenge of access to clean and safe water. We have undertaken the installation of a borehole with complete water treatment and filtration device setup. This infrastructural development will alleviate the regular search and lift the financial burden of buying water amongst indigent families and guarantee access to clean, safe, and potable water”
