 Emma Okonji Leofied has announced the launch of the biggest freelance platform in Africa, designed to strengthen commerce and the workforce across Africa. Leofied is an online community that connects consumers and businesses to freelance service professionals. With a target of $20 billion in freelance commerce over the next couple of years, Leofied plans to disrupt and improve the industry in Nigeria and across Africa. The platform provides a route for financial freedom for Nigerians and Africans allowing them to make money without limits from the comfort of their homes. With the looming market, Leofied connects the best freelancers across the continent to a global audience, monetizing skills and servicing organisations. The CEO of Leofied, Mr. Jonathan Frank Omonigho, said: “There are a couple of freelance platforms in  Africa but most have failed to cater for the needs of African freelancers in Africa. We could see how our workforce struggled during the pandemic. With Leofied, we seek to bridge this gap, improve on the lapses and provide a platform for this fast springing workforce to thrive on.” One of the major challenges Leofied seeks to improve on is that of payments. Leofied provides a variety of channels through which freelancers get paid both locally and internationally. These channels include, Cryptocurrency, international bank transfers, in-app wallets and lots more. Individuals and organizations are also not left behind as Leofied seeks to partner with top organisations looking to hire permanent and temporary manpower to execute jobs and projects,” Omonigho said. Today, African companies are working on the digitalisation of their activities to meet the needs of the international markets; and Leofied stands at the forefront of this for the freelance community.
