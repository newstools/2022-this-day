 Emirates has announced that it has embarked on a 30-city tour, scouting for the best hands and brains to join its cabin crew team, beginning from now until the end of June. The search, the airline said, would involve professional recruiters whose brief is to seek and recruit talented people with a passion for service, preparatory to an expected post-COVID air travel boom. Emirates’ teams will travel from Australia to the UK, and dozens of European cities in-between, as well as Cairo, Algiers, Tunis and Bahrain. Emirates Group’s Executive Vice President for Human Resources, Abdulaziz Al Ali said: “There’s no more exciting airline than Emirates for anyone interested in a flying career, and we’ve received tremendous interest since we began our recruitment drive for cabin crew in November. “While parts of the application process are done online, we always make the effort to meet our candidates in person whenever we can, and that is why our Talent Acquisition team is doing a whirlwind 30-city tour over the next 6 weeks to assess prospective candidates.” Emirates’ truly global cabin crew team represent 160 nationalities, reflecting its customer mix and international operations in over 130 cities on six continents. All Emirates crew are based in the exciting cosmopolitan city of Dubai, with company-provided accommodation, tax-free salary and more benefits.
