HighLife Among men, there are a few that have the grace to make things happen wherever you put them. These are the individuals that just get it: they get the dynamics of life, the flow of resources, the fluctuations of the future, and the vast infiniteness of wisdom. Barrister Allen Onyema, the CEO of Air Peace, is one such man. His charm is up there with the mythical demi-deities of old Greece, and even amid high-flying peers, he is peerless in his achievements. This is not the first time that Onyema is getting the limelight spreading around him. From the very start, the man has held that special position in the hearts of informed Nigerians everywhere. Maybe, it is because he had the cojones to start up an airline business where his associates and peers were still busy looking for where to invest their money and get the biggest ROIs. Regardless, Onyema has managed to climb to a height that others are having to crane their necks to catch a glimpse of him. Onyema made his big debut in Nigeria’s corporate corridor in 2013 when he officially established Air Peace. Onyema’s name and brand began to make the rounds back then, and it has continued to the present. After all, it is rare to have businessmen whose minds are fixed on goals other than aggressive profit-making. With Onyema’s intelligence, it is not surprising that he is also a dedicated philanthropist. He may not be given shots or corners in national dailies, but Onyema has made his contributions to the small people. And he continues to, regardless of the happenings around him, some of which are often very unpleasant to read about. But Onyema is one of those people with a magic wand to have things go their way. Thus, regardless of the issues that hold him back a bit, he always bounces back.
