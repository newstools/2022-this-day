* Niger CAN pays tribute Laleye Dipo in Minna The remains of Deborah Samuel, the Shehu Shagari College of Education Sokoto student who was gruesomely murdered by some irate Muslim students for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Mohammed, has been interred in Rijau town in Rijau Local Government Area of Nigeria State.Families and relations of the deceased spoke glowingly of her and prayed God to grant her eternal rest.Reverend Steven Makeri, who officiated at the interment, urged the parents of the deceased not to lose hope like unbelievers, saying that the death of Deborah should strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ.Reverend Makeri sued for peaceful coexistence among adherents of the major religions in the country, saying undue and unnecessary fanaticism will not bring about the unity and cohesion the nation require to make progress.In a condolence message, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Niger State chapter, said it was deeply sorry “to hear about the passing on to glory of our beloved sister Deborah”.In the message signed by the Chairman, Rev. Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, said:”Our deepest sympathy goes out to the entire Christian community in Niger State, most especially, the people of Rijau Local Government and her immediate family, at this difficult time.” It prayed that: “The happy memories of Deborah bring you comfort at this sad time.”Yohanna, who is also the Catholic Bishop of Kontagora Diocese, said CAN’s “thoughts and prayers are with the Christian community and all her family at this difficult time of sadness and bereavement”.“May God have mercy on her and grant her eternal rest. And may He grant the immediate family and indeed all of us the fortitude to bear the loss,” he further prayed.
