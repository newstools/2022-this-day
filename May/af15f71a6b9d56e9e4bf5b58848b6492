 Rebecca Ejifoma Hangout With Tee, a rewarding platform that seeks to inspire women into attaining sterling heights in their various fields while also keeping up with social life, recently held its 7th edition in Lagos. Themed ‘Unwrap Am’, the all-female gathering had motivational speeches from great minds, a dance competition, perks, a raffle draw, music, arts and crafts, photography and lots more. Participants were treated to a sumptuous musical delicacy by Eniola Larondo: a talking drum artist, DJ Jenny Switch, Kemistree, Ebele the Flutist; and Lydia Johnson.  For the convener, Titi Oyemade, her passion is for women to thrive. “I observed that a lot of women don’t have time for themselves because they are so occupied with work and taking care of everyone around them,” she said. That is why she felt the need to organise this event for them to loosen up and enjoy themselves. Adding, she expressed that the programme is on the quest to promote self-confidence, positivity and self-love. On her part, Nollywood star, Marcy Dolapo Oni, charged women to expand their knowledge. “Knowledge is power. Women should unwrap their skills and talents. “They should think about what comes to them naturally and nurture it. Women should put themselves out there and keep pushing.” For Oni, women should strive to put their best foot forward, especially when they find themselves in a male-dominated environment. “I also think women should go out there and do what they need to do.”
