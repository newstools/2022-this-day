 Alex Enumah in AbujaJustice Bello Kawu of a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Friday vacated his order stopping the All Progressives Congress (APC) planned National Convention.The convention, slated for March 26, is for the election of national officers of the party.Justice Kawu had, on November 18, last year, stopped the party and its Acting National Chairman, Mai Mala Buni, from going ahead with the convention pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging its organization.However, following a fresh application by Mr. Shuaibu Aruwa (SAN), the court on Friday vacated the said restraining order.Aruwa had argued that if the order was not vacated and the convention not held as at March 26, it would affect the timetable of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the 2023 general election.In a short ruling, the court vacated the order issued on November 18, 2021 and fixed March 30 for hearing of the main suit.Justice Kawu had, on November 18, 2021, while ruling in an exparte application, halted the APC convention to enable him reach a decision in the originating summons by Hon. Salisu Umoru challenging the planned convention.In the case with suit number FCT/HC/CV/2958/2021 and motion number FCT/HC/M/9655/21, the plaintiff prayed the court for an order of interlocutory injunction restraining the first and second defedants and their agents from organising, holding or conducting the National Convention of the APC in January and February or at any other date either before or after pending the hearing and determination of the suit.The judge, after granting the order, warned that the subject matter of the case is now subjudice and must nor be tampered with.The claimant informed the court that the mere inauguration of sub-committees for the March 26 National Convention when the order of the court is in force is a demonstration of disdain for the rule of law in the country.Details later…
