We also salute the spirit of sportsmanship of aspirants who made the huge sacrifice of stepping down for the emergence of consensus candidates. Their sacrifices saved the party of the unneeded rancour that usually trails elections such as this.“We are asking President Muhammed Buhari and other party stakeholders to consider Emefiele as most prominently qualified successor to the President in 2023. We believe very strongly that the country at this time needs a trusted and tested technocrat such as Emefiele as President in 2023 in order to further consolidate on the legacies and gains of this administration. We are also of the view that no leader can be said to have succeeded until such leader is succeeded by a worthy successor.”
