In between, he created Monaco’s second, with Kevin Volland turning his shot past the wrong-footed PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, with Pochettino clearly angered by the manner of his team’s collapse. It also followed their recent exit in the last 16 of the Champions League, letting slip a 2-0 aggregate lead to lose 3-2 at Real Madrid. “We can’t start a game the way we started this one,” added Pochettino. “You have to get out of the frustration of elimination in the Champions League.
