WORLD INDOOR CHAMPIONSHIP  American Grant Holloway equalled his own world indoor record in the semi-finals of the men’s 60m hurdles in Belgrade on Sunday. Holloway clocked 7.29 seconds to win the second of three semis, a time he previously set in Madrid in February last year. The 24-year-old American is a world 110m hurdles gold medallist, who also won silver at last summer’s Tokyo Olympics. Also yesterday, Yulimar Rojas became the first three-time world indoor triple jump champion as the Venezuelan set a new outright world record – both indoors and outdoors – to take the title in Serbia. The 26-year-old, who is also the Olympic champion and two-time reigning world outdoor champion, produced a 15.74m leap on her final attempt. Rojas’ previous world indoor record had stood at 15.43m, while her previous outdoor world record was 15.67m. There was silver for Ukraine’s Maryna Bekh-Romanchuk, following compatriot Yaroslava Mahuchikh’s high jump goldon Saturday. Bekh-Romanchuk embraced her coach after delivering a personal best 14.74m with her final jump, to finish ahead of Jamaica’s Kimberly Williams. The Ukrainian is also due to contest the long jump final, her preferred event, later on Sunday. In the men’s high jump, South Korea’s Woo Sanghyeok took gold with a clearance of 2.34m. That saw him finish ahead of Switzerland’s Loic Gasch, in silver, and Italy’s Olympic champion Gianmarco Tamberi – who famously shared the Olympic title with Mutaz Essa Barshim at Tokyo 2020.
