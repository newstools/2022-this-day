 James Sowole A professor of Ethics and Philosophy of Religious Studies at Dominican University, Samonda, Ibadan, Jude Mbukanma, has blamed decadence, particularly among youths, on the relegation of moral science in the nation’s educational institutions.Mbukanma said the absence of strong morals of patriotism, uprightness, diligence, contentment, the reward for hard work was responsible for various challenges confronting the country.The don spoke while delivering the first inaugural lecture of the university with the theme ‘The Abandonment of Moral Science In The Pursuit Of Natural Science Education; The Great Mistake In The Theory of Modernisation’.He, therefore, said the restoration of these values is the only way that the challenges can be tackled.Mbukanma said Nigerians and their leaders at various levels of government must embrace the virtues of patriotism and love for the country to lift the nation above its woes.“Let us give moral science a priority consideration in our educational system as we cannot expect good behaviour if moral isn’t in place and note that virtue is teachable and its reward is happiness,” said Mbukanma.Speaking at the event, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Anthony Akinwale, noted that it was “imperative to be reminded that the lecture of today challenges us to ensure that we do not separate politics from morality; and if separated, our challenges in the country will remain insurmountable.”
