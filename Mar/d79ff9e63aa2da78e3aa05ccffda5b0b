 I am not interested in the NANS President, Comrade Asefon Sunday’s uncouth and uncivil activism. Instead, I will like to comment on the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu who hasn’t been living up to expectations, and not practising what he preached on the altar of our newspapers. Before Mallam Adamu Adamu, a columnist and accountant became a minister, he had plethora of articles some of which were on ASUU strikes and the solutions. However, one would expect him to implement those solutions when he was made the Minister of Education. But no, he’s been adding salt to the injury of Nigerian students who are always at the receiving end. Since Adamu Adamu became the Minister of Education, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has gone on strike more than five times. This is very disheartening and does not befit our educational system. Students who applied for four years courses now spend five years on campus. Students who applied for five years courses now spend six years. What about the students who lost their lives while returning to their parents because ASUU was on strike? Mallam Adamu Adamu has failed as a Minister of Education. And if I were him, I won’t mind the money that come with the office. I’ll humbly resign and allow the person that can manage the ministry to take over. Of what use is a man who writes extensively on the solutions to a problem and fails when he’s called upon to implement his touted solutions? – Aremu Lukman Umor, Ilorin
