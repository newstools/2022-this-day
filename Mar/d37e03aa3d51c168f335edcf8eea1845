 The Federal Commissioner, National Commission For Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons(NCFRMI), Hon Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim, has said  that the NCFRMI does not have an Act yet but a bill awaiting presidential assent. According to her,  the bill  is currently in its final phase and would be assented to soonest by President Muhammadu Buhari,  whom she said is so passionate about the plights of the vulnerable ones in the society. Sulaiman-Ibrahim disclosed this yesterday  while soliciting improved collaboration with the media to further deepen the existing relationship between her commission and the fourth estate of the realm. The federal commissioner said  the mandate of the commission is to become a leading, world class humanitarian organisation with effective and sustainable solutions for all persons of concern. To achieve the mandate, she said  the commission is  adopting the following strategy to achieve its mandate; “strengthening of internal framework, streamlining of existing data, standardised digitalization, sustainable and durable solution, and strategic partnership for resource mobilisation.” She added that the strategic project drivers of the commission’s vision are at varying stages of implementation like the NCFRMI Project Zero Hunger initiative, which is a project aimed at bringing immediate relief to vulnerable persons of concern and their families facing food insecurity. According to her, it incorporates a whole-of-society and whole-of-systems approach to providing assistance and support to Persons of Concern and also developed to help streamline and enhance the accessibility, distribution and availability of food and non-food items, thereby eliminating waste and duplication of efforts that was evident in the previous means of distribution. Others are: Project Skill Up, which is designed to train selected persons of concerns across trades such as carpentry, welding and others. The commissioner, who took time to reel out all she has been doing reiterated the commission’s commitment to strengthening collaboration among all stakeholders and to ensure a concerted effort in providing support and assistance to Persons of Concern in Nigeria.
