 By Udora Orizu The African Centre for Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR) has described the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia, which on Friday nullified Section 84 (12)  of the newly amended Electoral Act, as the needed tonic to strengthen the nation’s electoral space.The ACJHR who made its position known in a statement by its coordinator, Nduka Edede Chinomso, noted that with the judgment, Justice Evelyn Anyadike, had contributed in no small measure in preserving the nation’s democracy.The statement read: “From the beginning, we knew, just like other right-thinking Nigerians and groups, that the controversial section was discriminatory against public office holders. The nation’s constitution clearly did not envisage the exclusion of any Nigerian that is of age from the democratic process, but this section did.“We therefore believe very strongly that this judicial pronouncement will strengthen the nation’s electoral space and allow more qualified Nigerians to participate. It is a victory for democracy and the rule of law.”Similarly, the Nigerian Ethnic Youth Leaders (NEYLC) hailed the nullification of Section 84 (12) of the newly amended Electoral Act by High Court.The NEYLC, which is made up of the Arewa Consultative Youths Movement (ACYM), Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths Movement, Oduduwa Youths and Middle Belt Youths, made its position known in a statement signed by the Ohanaeze Secretary General and head of coalition’s secretariat, Nwada Ike Chiamaka.The group said it was clear from the beginning that the controversial section was conceived to witch hunt appointees of government.The statement reads, “We cannot but commend the courage of the court in delivering such a sound judgment that we believe will stand a test of time.”We knew from the beginning that the section was deliberately inserted to witch hunt appointees of government.”We therefore hope that this judgment has put a stop to that injustice and that the political space is now widen to accommodate as many qualified and interested Nigerians.”
