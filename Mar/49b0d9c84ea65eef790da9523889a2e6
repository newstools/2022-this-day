Also speaking on the topic, “How to build top of mind awareness on a budget”, the Chief Executive Officer of X3M Group, Mr. Steve Babaeko, advised entrepreneurs to build a strong network of partners and customers. According to him, “networking presents you with the opportunity to find others who are either in similar circumstances or can buy into your business. When you network appropriately, doors start to open, and your brand is top of mind. Building professional relationships can help you get new customers, retain current customers, and manage your reputation. Your network is your net worth”.

Ensure you commit to doing the right thing, including compliance with laws, regulations and paying taxes. It is a lot more affordable to do the right thing. Though Tax compliance can be complicated, having the right knowledge can help you”. Group Technology Programme Manager at FCMB Group Plc, Mr. Emeka Eboegbune equally offered tips on “How to harness technology in transforming your business”. He advised entrepreneurs to leverage on digital platforms to market their products and services, adding that: “To succeed in the digital space, you need to focus on people who work with you. First, consider the skills of your employees. The more digital-minded employees you have, the easier it is for your organisation to grow and succeed. You need to continually refresh your product and respond very quickly to the change in the market. Keep your finger on the pulse of your business, know where customers are going to, why they go there and what they need. Data will help you with that.”
