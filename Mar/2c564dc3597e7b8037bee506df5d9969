According to him, the jump in the Group’s revenue which rose by 14.9 percent from N5 billion recorded in 2020 to N5.8 billion in 2021, was driven by a 24.8 percent growth in listing fees which grew to N757.4 million as against N606.9 million in 2020, 4.9 percent growth in its treasury investment income and a 2.1 percent growth in the transaction fees which rose to N2.9 billion from N2.8 billion recorded in 2020.
