 27-year-old Nigerian R&B singer-songwriter, Noon Dave, debuts a love-themed new single ‘Brunch’. Born David Obafemi, Noon Dave, taps into his songwriting inspiration from a diverse exposure of soaking up elements of soul, R&B, pop and of course Afrobeats to create a unique sound. Noon Dave is carving his own niche in the music scene by creating an experience with his songs.The newly signed Chocolate City Music RnB artist, who grew up in the city of Lagos, infuses RnB elements in his music. The single which is a lead of his forthcoming project is accompanied by a vibrant display of subtle and pure vocals.On this single, he sings almost exclusively about taking his lover to brunch or, more specifically, about the tillating promise of sex. This oozing sensuality yields mood music as he treats consent like a warm embrace. This new single “Brunch” is a classic throwback with daring yet not too risque lyrics. Evidently, Noon Dave has long explored the friction between new wave and old-school R&b, but it’s never felt so fresh with the infusion of pidgin; both timeless and futurisitic, familiar but retro. Speaking on this single, Noon Dave explains: “Brunch was very much inspired by Saint JHN’s music I listened to and this moved me to make a song lovers can enjoy whilst having a great time.” Noon Dave is a new variety of RnB artists in Nigeria and he wants listeners to be exceptionally entertained by his music.
