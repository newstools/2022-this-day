 Funmi Ogundare Following the controversy over the sale of a parcel of land belonging to Methodist Boys High School, Lagos, for commercial purpose by the Methodist Church, the alumni President of the school, Mr. Kolapo Sogbetun, has appealed to the church to partner the association in putting up projects that will benefit the students and enable the school regain its lost glory.According to report, sometime in 2012, the church, under the leadership of Prelate Sunday Ola Makinde had attempted to plunder part of the property (measuring about two acres) of the school for commercial purposes, which is non- educational. He maintained that the church had obtained a new Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) and survey plan in the name of the church on the same land from educational to commercial purpose without any proof of assertion.​In July 2021, an old boy noticed that the church had affixed to the external fence of the school, a sign advertising the stretch of the land and calling on developers for a joint venture to construct luxurious flat under a project called, ‘The Wesley’, for sale to interested buyers/subscribers for commercial purpose.The move by the church didn’t go down well with the alumni of the school as the president told journalists during the 144th Founder’s Day celebration that it is in blatant violation of the purpose of educational use stated in the C of O.“There’s a dispute between us and the Methodist Church. As a matter of fact, we are sitting on 5.77 hectares extending to Kuramo waters. There is a portion of land which they have said they want to use to construct luxurious flats and we are saying no, that we will not take such other than for educational purposes. We objected to the erection of the luxury flats and they stopped.”He said the C of O number 25/25/1983N​ is in the name of Methodist Boys High School which statutory right was granted by the Lagos State government, adding that the parcel of land which measured 5.771 hectares within the Maroko Scheme phase one, gives the school the exclusive right of alienation, ownership and possession without disturbance from any other separate entity.​Sogbetun noted that the alumni have been advised by the Attorney General to refer the matter to court of arbitration (ADR), while expressing concern that the church had also obtained a C of O during Governor Babatunde Fashola’s administration in 2012, with a different title which does not reflect the name of the school.“So we are trying to approach the ADR for a resolution so that they can revoke the one in the name​ of Methodist Church. In law, there is a priority rule which says the first in time prevails.“So the name will continue to be in Methodist Boys High School, Lagos, and we do not want our property or the assets of the school to be used for commercial purposes, which might eventually be turned into brothel. It’s going to be an eyesore. We have a piece of land left and we don’t want any encroachment by the church,” the president stressed.
