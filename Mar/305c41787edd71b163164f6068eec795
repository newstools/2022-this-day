 The English Football Association announced the Young Lions rosters  yesterday ahead of international matches later this month, with 12 Nigeria-eligible players getting invites. Arsenal loanee Folarin Balogun and PSV winger Nonso Madueke have been selected for the England U21 squad for their European Championship qualifiers against Andorra at Bournemouth on March 25 and in Albania the following Tuesday. The two players already have competitive caps for England at U21 level, with Balogun making his debut against Kosovo in September while Madueke debuted at the U21 EURO back in March 2021. Chelsea-owned attacking midfielder Faustino Anjorin and West Ham U23 skipper Ajibola Alese have received call-ups to the England U20 squad for matches with Poland and Germany.
