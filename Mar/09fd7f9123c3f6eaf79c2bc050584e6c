 Laleye Dipo in Minna The Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA) has raised the alarm over the likelihood of the outbreak of meningitis and other related diseases as a result of the warm environment currently being experienced across the state.NSEMA said people in communities across the state should therefore take precautionary measures including staying in well-ventilated houses and avoiding crowded areas.It also admonisheed the people to wear light clothes as a result of the prevailing heat conditions.The Director General of the agency, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Inga, in a statement in Minna on Monday, urged the people tostop indiscriminate felling of trees and also plant more trees to serve and preserve the environment against desertification. Inga, who said the warning became necessary so as to build the resilience of communities who may be at risk,  advised the people to take a lot of water and liquid substances to avoid dehydration.The Director General said NIMET had also predicted the commencement of the rains in the state this year at between April and May and therefore challenged the people to ensure all drainages are cleared in order to avoid flooding.He told the people “not to build on water ways, avoid dumping of refuse in drainages and limit activities around river banks at the peak of raining season to avoid being flooded”.Quoting NIMET’s predictions, Inga said the rains this year is expected to last for between 100 and 200 days, while there will be a 15-day dry spell between May and August.He therefore urged farmers to contact the Niger State Agricultural Mechanisation and Development Agency (NAMDA) for flood resistant and improved seedlings.
