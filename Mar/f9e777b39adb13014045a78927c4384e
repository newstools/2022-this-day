Also JAMB revealed that the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) mock examination would now hold on April 9, and not April 16 as earlier scheduled. The examination body explained that the change in date was due to the realisation that April 16, earlier scheduled, was Easter Saturday; a holy Saturday, celebrated by Christians to mark the end of the Lent period before Easter Sunday.
