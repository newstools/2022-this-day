 Adedayo Akinwale in Abuna The Abuja chapter of Yoruba Council of Obas has thrown its weight behind the presidential aspiration of former Governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Tinubu. The Head, Media and Publicity, Tinubu Support Group (TSG), Mr. Tosin Adeyanju, announced this in a statement he issued yesterday in Abuja that quoted the monarchs to have said that Tinubu was the best presidential material in 2023. The Oba of Yoruba and the Chairman Yoruba Traditional Council, FCT Chapter, Oba Olusegun Salau, who led other monarchs to TSG campaign office yesterday in Abuja, said the managerial skills, technical know-how, and national appeal of Tinubu put him in the best position to rule Nigeria in 2023. He said: “We are praying for Jagaban for long life and we are also praying that he becomes the next President of Nigeria. Tinubu is eminently qualified for the presidential position, the record he created as the governor of Lagos hasn’t been matched by anyone. ‘‘Tinubu has worked so hard for the APC. He is not new to global politics and will certainly apply his extensive networks to project Nigeria’s image and boost the economy of this nation.” The monarchs assured that they would mobilise other Yoruba Obas in northern Nigeria to ensure that Tinubu emerged as President in 2023. Other Traditional rulers on the entourage were Chief of Yoruba Zuba, Oba MA Odubanku; Chief of Bwari Kingdom, Oba Elias Abiodun; Oba Adeleke Odeyemi of Bwari Emirate and Otunba of FCT, Mr. Wasiu Tunwase. Responding, TSG Director-General, Mr. Umar Ibrahim, said that Tinubu has been identified as a patriot in words, action, and in deeds. He described the national leader of APC as a detribalised Nigerian with a national outlook and an accomplished politician and a seasoned administrator.
