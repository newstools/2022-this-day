John Shiklam The Kaduna State Government has imposed a 24-hour curfew on Jama’a and Kaura Local Government Areas of the state to avert an outbreak of violence. Angry youths in the council areas were said to have protested against Sunday’s killings of 26 people and the burning of about 70 houses in three communities in Kaura council area.An eyewitness said hundreds of angry youths blocked the roads condemning the government for failing to deal with the terrorists attacking communities. According to the eyewitness, “The boys were very angry over the killings and the burning of houses on Sunday. “There was no security on the ground so they started blocking roads. “Eventually, they saw a J5 bus coming and they attacked the bus. Suddenly riot police personnel arrived. “On arrival, the police opened fire on the boys. One of the boys was hit. “They became angrier and set the bus ablaze. This resulted in serious tension in the area as people were afraid of outbreak of violence.”In a statement in Kaduna, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the decision to impose curfew on the two council areas was based on advice from security agencies. He said: “Following advice from security agencies, the Kaduna State Government has declared a 24-hour curfew on Jema’a and Kaura Local Government Areas with immediate effect. “This is to assist the security agencies to stabilize the situation in the areas, save lives and property and enable the restoration of law and order.”Aruwan added that security agencies have full authorization to enforce the curfew. “Government appeals to all residents of Jema’a and Kaura Local Government Areas to cooperate with the security agencies in the urgent task of restoring peace and upholding law and order. “Government condemns the violence and all acts of lawlessness that have occurred in the area. Further updates will be issued as necessary,” he said.
