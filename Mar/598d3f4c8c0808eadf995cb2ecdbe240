 Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Katsina State, challenged the state government to publish names and operators of the 232 accounts, which the administration of Alhaji Aminu Masari claimed to have inherited in 2015. The main opposition party also challenged the state government to explain to the citizens of the state the kind of transactions that took place in the 232 bank accounts within the period under review. The Chairman of Katsina PDP, Mr. Salisu Majigiri sought this clarification at a session with journalists yesterday, insisting that the administration of Alhaji Shehu Shema did not operate 232 accounts. The Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Faruk Jobe had claimed that the administration of Aminu Masari had closed 232 accounts inherited from PDP and recovered N4 billion in 2015. While reacting to the allegation yesterday, however, Majigiri said: “What the commissioner said is not true. We have not left 232 accounts in several banks in Katsina to the best of our knowledge. He insisted that the Shema administration did not inherit 232 accounts as the Masari administration claimed. He, thus, challenged the Masari administration “to publish the names of the 232 bank accounts and operators of the accounts in national dailies because there is no account being operated without a signatory. “And the administration said they mopped up N4 billion in the accounts. So, that means if they mopped up N4 billion from the 232 accounts that we have not submitted officially. We have left N14.5 billion in the state coffers in 2015”. “This has shown that we have left all together N18.5 billion including the N4 billion the administration claimed that they recovered from the 232 accounts but there is no single N3 billion project to show in the state,” Majigiri observed.
