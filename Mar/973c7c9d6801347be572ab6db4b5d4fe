Super Eagles attacker Samuel Kalu yesterday made his debut for Watford when he came on in the second half but could not help the Hornets from suffering 3-2 defeat against Arsenal. Another Nigerian international, Oghenekaro Etebo just coming back from injury lay-off was an used substitute for Watford. The Nigeria international was handed his debut for Watford since joining from Ligue 1 side Bordeaux on a three-year deal on January 26. The 24-year-old, who has won 17 caps for Nigeria and scored twice for the Super Eagles, was yet to feature for the Hornets until yesterday. Kalu was introduced in the 89th minute for former Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley but he could not help his side despite his stunning performance. His first touch was excellent while he almost scored with his second. With his performance in the game, more playing time seems to await him which could improve the Watford side as they battle to escape the drop.
