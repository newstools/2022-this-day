 Francis Sardauna in Katsina The federal government, in a bid to reduce the number of out-of-school children in Katsina State, is currently feeding 833,957 pupils of public primary schools under its Home Grown School Feeding Programme (HGSFP). The State Coordinator of Social Protection and Good Family Values Initiative, Mr. Muhammed Bara’u, stated this Sunday in Rimi during a solidarity rally by beneficiaries of the programme across the 361 wards of the state. Bara’u explained that the federal government has engaged 10,549 food vendors across 2,777 public primary schools in the state to provide nutritious food to the pupils. He further noted that no fewer than 14,000 graduates and National Certificate of Education holders have been employed by the federal government through the N-power programme in the state. According to him, 143,000 households are currently benefiting from the government’s Conditional Cash Transfer Programme (CCTP) from across the 34 local government areas of the state. He, however, called on the federal government and the National Assemblies to provide constitutional backing for the National Social Investment Programme (N-SIP) in order to ensure its sustainability.
