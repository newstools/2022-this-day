David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka A group, South-East Nigeria Democratic League (SENDL), has said that the Minister of Transportation, Chief Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, is the most competent to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. The group called on the minister to run for the position of president of Nigeria, saying they have seen in him inherent leadership qualities that others jostling for the position lack. Coordinator of the group, Prince Jude Emeka Okoye while speaking to journalists in Anambra State yesterday, said that Amaechi has acquitted himself creditably both as governor of oil-rich Rivers State and as minister, having supervised the infrastructural rejuvenation with tremendous work on the railway system across Nigeria. Okoye said: “As the Muhammadu Buhari administration nears terminal date, it is very clear that what the country needs now is a courageous, hardworking and widely accepted persons with good knowledge of the system to carry-on with the ongoing infrastructure rebirth and reforms that can ensure survival of the country in spite of multifarious challenges. Amaechi undoubtedly fits the bill.” He described Amaechi as a detribalised Nigerian with requisite stature and widespread acceptance across the country’s ethnic nationalities and can mobilise support across board if he is allowed to serve as president. Okoye said that Amaechi’s detribalised nature was the reason he was recently turbaned as Dan Amanar Daura in far away Katsina State, the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari. “We are already mobilissing persons of like-minds to garner necessary support for Chibuike Amaechi and encourage him to throw his hat in the ring, convinced that Nigerians will be the ultimate beneficiary of his stewardship,” Okoye said.
