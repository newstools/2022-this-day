The President, African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, has congratulated former President Olusegun Obasanjo on his 85th birthday. Adesina, in a goodwill message issued on Saturday, described Obasanjo’s contributions to Nigeria, Africa and the world as exemplary. “On behalf of myself, my wife, Grace and the entire family of the African Development Bank, I am writing to wish you a very happy 85th birthday,” he said. According to Adesina, Obasanjo’s life has continued to inspire. “Your selflessness towards causes in Africa as well as global issues, have always shown that your heart and passion are to drive transformation and seek solutions to pressing development challenges facing Africa and developing nations. “Anyone that knows you would immediately wonder how someone at your age can work several times harder than people who are half your age. “Your passion and commitment to the younger generation are further exemplified by your always finding time and resources to encourage and support the youth, especially in agriculture. “You have remained engaged with former Heads of State and Government across Africa, to relentlessly find solutions to challenges and mediate to resolve conflicts. “This includes service as UN High Representative, African Union High Representative and election observer in several countries. “I wish that I would be as strong as you when I get to your age. “Your contributions to Nigeria, Africa and the world are exemplary. “May God continue to grant you grace, strength and good health as you continue to provide selfless service to humanity, and especially to Africa. “I look forward to seeing you at your 85th birthday lecture in Abeokuta to be delivered by President Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of Rwanda.
