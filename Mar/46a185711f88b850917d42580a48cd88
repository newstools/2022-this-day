 Chinedu Eze United Airlines and Certified Africa, a travel and tour company that simplifies travel to Africa, have teamed up to create convenient options for travellers looking to visit Africa for African heritage experiences. Travellers can now visit www.certifiedafrica.com to book all-in-one private or group travel experiences that include United flights. The customizable experience packages also include accommodations, airport pick up/drop off, transportation, cultural tours, activities along with some meals and guides. Certified Africa also helps ensure travelers are prepared and informed about travel requirements like visas, immunisations, Covid-19 precautions and travel insurance. “One of the most intimidating aspects of traveling abroad is the unknown. Every new culture has its own customs, languages, and traditions, which can be hard to navigate if you’re not used to them,” said Certified Africa Co-Founder Kristin Tellis Quaye. “With Certified Africa’s staff and guides accompanying you and the added convenience of United flights included you can feel comfortable and ready for the unknown when traveling to Africa and immersing yourself in heritage and culture,” she added.
