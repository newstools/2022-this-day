 Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The leadership crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC), has stalled plans by the party to challenge the defection of Governors of Sokoto, Benue and Edo States to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of their second term re-elections. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto state, Samuel Ortom of Benue State and Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, were elected in their first term on the platform of APC, but defected to PDP, on which platform they secured their second terms.THISDAY gathered that the decision of the ruling party to challenge their defection was sequel to the recent Federal High Court judgement that  Governor Dave Umahi, should be removed for defecting to APC having been elected on the PDP platform. Against this background, the ruling party had considered instituting a similar case against the governors and some PDP leaders, who were formerly in APC. A party source, who pleaded anonymity said a team of lawyers, had been briefed, but action was stalled due to the ongoing leadership crisis rocking the party. The source, however, added that the legal battle would commence as soon as the leadership crisis was resolved.“It is true the party is in the process of instituting a suit against some governors, who defected from our party to the opposition PDP. The action would have since commenced but for the leadership crisis. “I can reliably tell you that we have concluded consultations with a team of lawyers, as soon as the ongoing leadership crisis is resolved, we hope to commence the action,” the source said. It was also gathered that the party had resolved to join a former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki in the suit.The party, sources claimed, was seeking a 30-year ban on Saraki from contesting any elective post in the country for committing the same offence of detection.
