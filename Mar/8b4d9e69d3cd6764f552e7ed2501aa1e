 Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Katsina State Police Command has said that it has not received an official letter from the Katsina State Independent Electoral Commission (KATSIEC) notifying it of the April 11 local governments’ elections in the state. The command’s Public Relations Officer, Superintendent Gambo Isah, disclosed this while answering questions from journalists on the preparedness of the command ahead of the council polls. The Chairman of the KATSIEC, Mr. Ibrahim Bako, announced during a press conference that the state local governments election would be conducted on April 11, 2022. But Isah said: “I can’t comment on that because the Katsina State Police Command has not even received an official letter from either the state Independent Electoral Commission or the state government informing us of the election. “But I believe there is going to be a security council’s meeting either on Monday or Tuesday and that is where the state INEC will adequately brief the security agencies on the local government election.” He, however, noted that the command would get reinforcement from the Inspector-General of Police and other security agencies for the conduct of the election, assuring that the election would be hitch-free. According to him, “we have been conducting elections here and they are always hitch-free. So, I don’t see anything that is going to be different in this local government election.”
