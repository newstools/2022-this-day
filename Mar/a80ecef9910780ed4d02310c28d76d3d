 From George Okoh in Makurdi The Benue State Police command has arrested three persons in connection with the death of a lady in a hotel in Benue state. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) SP Catherine Anene, disclosed this while confirming the incident in Makurdi. The young lady was found dead, last weekend, at a hotel around the Nyiman area of Makurdi, the Benue State capital. A source disclosed that the lady, of about 20 years, had lodged into the hotel with a man, yet to be identified, but was later found dead in the room. While some of the sources said  the deceased lady must have died during a sex romp with her partner, others further alleged that she was killed and her private parts removed and taken away by the “Yahoo boy” for ritual purposes. Confirming the report, the Police PPRO, Anene did not confirm the rumour that her private parts were removed. She said no part of the deceased body was missing at the time her remains were picked from the hotel room. Anene said: “There is a death report of a lady in a hotel but details will come from the doctors, though we didn’t see marks of violence on the body. So, the autopsy will reveal the cause of the death. The person that died was dressed but we didn’t see marks on her body meaning there are no injuries. Three suspects were arrested in connection with this case so they will give us details. We can’t say it is a case of murder because we didn’t see marks of violence.”
