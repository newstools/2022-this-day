 Francis Sardauna in Katsina Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State has debunked the rumour making the rounds that he met President Muhammudu Buhari in London over the current leadership crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Addressing journalists at the Government House, Katsina Monday evening, Masari’s acting Director-General on Media, Al-amin Isa, described the speculation as fiction of the imagination of those peddling it. There are speculations in Katsina that the governor had travelled to London to lobby President Buhari on the need to end the leadership crisis bedevilling the APC. But Isa, during the media chat, said: “The main reason for addressing you today (Monday) is to dispel a rumour going round that His Excellency has travelled to London to lobby President Muhammudu Buhari on the APC crisis. “We want to state categorically clear that His Excellency has not travelled anywhere recently. And all the rumours going round are just the fiction of the imaginations of those people speculating it.” According to the acting director-general on media, “His Excellency has not travelled and he has not gone to London as people are speculating.”
