 Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyeola, has urged the electorate  in the state not to fall for the antics of the opposition parties, who he said are out to distract them ahead of the July 16 governorship election in the state. Oyetola stated this during an engagement programme organised by the state Civic Engagement Centre for Osun State Conference of Artists Designers, House and Spraying Painter yesterday in Osogbo. Represented by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Mr. Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, the governor also urged members of his party, All Progressives Congress (APC) and the electorate to remain focus on the task of his reelection bid. Oyetola, who noted that APC is still intact and indivisible in the state, urged them not to be agitated, but to remain resolute, unflinching and committed to the task ahead, noting that the mission is achievable and accomplishable. The governor urged the party members to continue to educate the populace on the need for stability, sustainability and continuity of his people-oriented style of governance. “As election is approaching ,we tasked all our  members at all level to employ door-to-door strategy to remind the electorate why our administration should be given a second chance to complete its developmental agenda for the state. “Osun State APC is strong and indivisible. I want to appeal to our members as well as the electorate not to be deceived or distracted by deceit made by opposition parties.“You have seen and witness a lot of positive impacts and achievements  we had made since the inception of our administration, and you can be rest assured of more better things to come when we are reelected,” he said. Oyetola, who noted that the opposition would soon engage in campaign of calumny with fake promises, urged the electorate to be firm in their determination to ensure continuity of his government.
