Gratitude, in the words of Henry Ward Beecher, an American clergyman, is the fairest blossom that springs from the soul. These moving words must have goaded the CNN award-winning journalist and Queen of the Apomu Kingdom in Osun State, Olori Janet Afolabi when she decided to join the league of authors with her debut book titled “The Masters Who Trained Me”.In the book, the seasoned journalist sets out to remember those who took her on the journey of learning to become a master and successful journalist. She thus penned the new book as an acknowledgement of excellence of the works of the famous Ray Ekpu, Dan Agbese, Yakubu Mohammed, Soji Akinrinade, Nosa Igiebor and Dare Babarinsa – all mentors who guided, trained and tutored her till she decided that their efforts deserve to be documented for posterity. Afolabi’s six-chapter new book was unveiled last week at the Alapomu Palace Hall in Apomu, Osun, as part of the activities to mark the second coronation anniversary of her husband and the Alapomu of Apomu, His Royal Majesty Oba Kayode Adenekan Afolabi. Afolabi said she wrote the book to “honour these renowned journalists who trained, drilled and moulded me into someone with valuable skills. They gave me a media platform to operate, explore and express myself. They gave me wings to fly in the winds of journalism travails and triumphs. I want to appreciate them while they are alive. I am expressing my gratitude by giving them a gift that will live after them.” While presenting the book, Gbenga Adefaye, General Manager/Editor-In-Chief of Vanguard Newspapers, described it as an important gift that should last till eternity. Some of the guests during the presentation included first-class monarchs, top government functionaries and media executives.
