James Emejo Aggregate Company Income Tax (CIT) declined to N347.81 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 (Q4 2021), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said yesterday. This represented a 26.39 per cent decline when compared to the N472.52 billion recorded in Q3 2021. Year-on-year however, CIT collections increased by 17.61 per cent compared to Q4 2020. The NBS in its CIT Q4 report stated that local payments amounted to N258.85 billion, while foreign CIT payment contributed N88.96 billion. The decline in company profits may not be unconnected with the prevailing business environment including insecurity, foreign exchange and other government policy. In terms of sectoral contributions, information and communication N51.05 billion or 19.72 per cent, manufacturing N45.09 billion or 17.42 per cent and financial and insurance activities N31.06 billion or 12 per cent, all accounted for the top three largest shares of CIT Q4. On the other hand, the top three lowest shares in CIT in the review period included activities of households as employers, undifferentiated goods- and services-producing activities of households for own use which amounted to N189.45 million or 0.07 per cent while water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation activities contributed N328.58 million or 0.13 per cent as well as activities of extraterritorial organisations and bodies which recorded N447.01 million or 0.17 per cent.
