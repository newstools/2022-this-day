 Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano Kano State Chapter of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) was thrown into confusion yesterday  following the  exit of  its candidate in 2019 governorship  election, Abba Kabir Yusuf and his running mate, Comrade Aminu Abdulsalam Gwarzo,  to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). The Kwankwasiyya faction dominated the PDP in the state, and their exit may have reduced the political fortunes of the platform as the nation marched towards the 2023 General election. Yusuf lost the governorship battle to Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, the incumbent governor of the state in the run-off three years ago. The former governorship candidate’s defection to the NNPP came on the heels of rumour of alleged plot by his political godfather, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso to join the party on March 30. At a brief, but elaborate ceremony at his Diso Ward in Gwale Local Government area of Kano State, Yusuf  said PDP has failed the people of Kano and its leader in the state, Rabiu Kwankwaso, despite massively voting for the party in 2019. He explained that there is no difference between his former party, and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The former  governorship candidate said his decision to dump the opposition party was sequel to the yearning of his teeming supporters. Also, the running mate,Gwarzo defected to NNPP at his Gwarzo ward yesterday. Gwarzo  announced his defection at the instance of party leaders
