By Bashir Gidado Jegawa Some of the desirable traits of Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, are humility, rationality,  reasonableness and tolerance and I believe, these are the qualities that are propelling him forward to reach the enviable height he has attained thus far. The trajectory of his politics has proved beyond doubt that Tambuwal does not believe in hurling insults and abuses on the opposition, let alone physically harming anyone in the name of partisan interest.To illustrate this fact, I will start by narrating a recent incident,  then go further down memory lane,  to buttress my assertions. Last week, a delegation from a fellow contender for the PDP presidential ticket (Senator Bukola Saraki) came to Sokoto to consult with PDP stakeholders and seek their support for Saraki’s aspiration.  Guess what? Tambuwal promptly sent a delegation to receive the visitors at the airport, provided vehicles for them, received them on a courtesy call at the Government House and hosted them to dinner. What other politician can be so hospitable to a competitor?In the course of his stewardship as the Governor of Sokoto State, Tambuwal has succeeded in the elimination of political thuggery by  banning the use of any form of weapon during campaigns, thereby restoring decency and peaceful conduct of elections.In spite of sustained provocation from an opposition that is cultured in the primitive  politics of bad blood, Tambuwal has introduced issue –  based campaigns by turning attention away from personality attack, mudslinging, and bickering  He has always extended olive branch to the opposition,  to embrace peace,  close ranks and work with him to move the state forward.The outcome of Tambuwal’s positive posture is glaring, made evident by the partnership existing between the state legislature, which is evenly composed of members of the main political parties in the state.He has refused to witch-hunt even his sworn enemies, and restrained from revisiting past government’s activities, let alone probe them. Instead he moved on by endeavoring to complete and expand the projects they started.Tambuwal allows people to express themselves freely and criticise him and his government.  Anybody can go to a radio station or social media and say whatever they like, with some Clerics  using their platforms to directly attack him and his person but he never for once, got anyone arrested. This is tolerance at its peakOh lest I forget!Do you know that the  State Secretary of the opposition APC is still a civil servant in the employment of Sokoto State Government but he was never harassed or intimidated?Just what kind of a man is TambuwaI, I leave all people of reason to judge.*Bashir Gidado Jegawa is the Commissioner for Commerce and Industry Sokoto
