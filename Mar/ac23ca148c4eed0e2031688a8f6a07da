 League leaders Rivers United maintained top spot on the 2021/2022 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) log at the conclusion of Match-day 18 following a 0-0 draw away to Gombe United.Faced with pressure from their closest challengers, Plateau United who forced a draw away at Enyimba 24 hours earlier, Rivers United knew they needed at least a draw to stay top and they got just that at the Pantami stadium. While the result kept the title dream of Rivers United alive, Gombe United consequently missed out on a chance to go further up the table and remain stuck at mid-table.Second place Plateau United had on Saturday extended their unbeaten run to ten games with a 1-1 draw against Enyimba in Aba with Fidelis Ilechukwu’s men going behind to a Victor Mbaoma strike in the 28th minute. With 19 minutes left to play, former Enyimba star Austine Opara ensured they returned to Jos with a share of the spoils with the leveller. They maintain their second position at the end of the round of matches.Remo Stars went into their game against Niger Tornadoes in 3rd position but slipped further down the log after losing 0-1 with Musa Wakili’s penalty in the 4th minute earning Tornadoes all three points in the game decided at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna. The biggest winners of the MatchDay were Rangers International who were 3-0 winners over champions Akwa United away from home. Coach Abdu Maikaba punished his former employers with the trio of Samuel Pam, Chidiebere Nwobodo and Shedrack Asiegbu scoring in the 55th, 70th and 90th minute respectively to silence the partisan fans at the Nest of Champions.RESULTSAkwa Utd 0-3 RangersLobi  1-2 Abia WarriorsGombe 0-0 Rivers UtdNasarawa 1-1 MFM FCEnyimba 1-1 Plateau UtdKwara Utd 2-1 HeartlandSunshine 2-1 DakkadaKatsina Utd 1-0 Wikki Tornadoes 1-0 Remo Shooting 1-0 Kano
