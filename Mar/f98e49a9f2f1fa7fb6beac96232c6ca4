 After playing hide and seek with their team list for several days, Ghana’s Head Coach, Otto Addo, yesterday named a 27-man squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup playoffs against the Super Eagles of Nigeria. Crystal Palace forward Jordan Ayew who is down with Covid-19 was listed in the squad even as he’s going to seat out the first leg fixture. Belgium-based duo of Denis Odoi and Elisha Owusu, Montari Kamahene of Ashdod FC in Israel and Dennis Korsah of Hearts of Oak were handed debut call-ups by Addo. Roma youngster Felix Afena-Gyan is also included in the squad after he failed to make the cut to the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Captain, Andre Ayew, is conspicuously missing due to his suspension. Ghana will host the first leg at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium in Kumasi on Friday before travelling to Abuja for the second leg next week Tuesday.
