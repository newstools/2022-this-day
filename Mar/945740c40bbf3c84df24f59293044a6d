Godfatherism is an interesting concept. On the one hand, it lets an individual reach higher and further than they ordinarily would. On the other hand, it depicts the individual as incompetent to some degree. At least, this is something that people are accusing Bukola Odeleye (the man known as Beedel) of. When people talk about Odeleye, they usually speak of him in terms of his brilliance, excellent management skills, and how far he has brought his company, Beedel Constructions. However, despite what others might consider peerless talent and overreaching management of the resources at his command, there are a few individuals who have something less flattering to say about Odeleye. The word on the street is that Odeleye has begun to rely a bit too much on his godfather, Seyi Makinde, the executive Governor of Oyo State. This is despite Odeleye being highly regarded as the protégé of Honorable Shina Peller, the member of the Federal House of Representatives representing the Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Iwajowa/Kajola Federal Constituency in Oyo. The implications of the casual accusation against Odeleye are significant. Before now, the consensus was that the young man had a potential that threatened even those super successful businessmen of the older generation, not to mention his peers. However, with talk of his name dropping, Odeleye has become one of the young geniuses labelled as relying on the prestige of other people to establish himself. So, will the glory that appeared to have been raised from the ground up by Odeleye suddenly belong to Makinde and Peller—but Makinde mostly? The young people who follow Odeleye would hope not. Anyway, such is life. It is a blessing of many lifetimes to have someone else paving the road. However annoying it is to other people, Odeleye knows Makinde and everybody should know it
