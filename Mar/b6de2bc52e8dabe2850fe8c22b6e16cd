 David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Anambra State Police Command has said that indigenes of the state who intend to hold open events must notify the command to provide security. The State Commissioner of Police, CP. Echeng Echeng, said this is in view of two attacks by gunmen on burials ceremonies in the state. Echeng assured the state of improved security service delivery and the command’s readiness to contain any security situation. A press release issued by the State Police Command’s Spokesperson, DSP. Toochukwu Ikenga, said the commissioner showed worry over an attack at the weekend by gunmen at a burial in Nnewi South Local Government Area. “The CP urged the good people of Anambra to always inform the police and other security agents of the venue, date and time of their events. This shall enable police access the area to make sure no security breach is experienced before, during and after the activity. “Two weeks ago, some persons suspected to be cultists had also invaded the venue of a burial and shot dead about 20 persons,” he said. Ikenga said: “On the two unfortunate incidents witnessed in the state, police were not informed of these burial events before it began. “The command wishes to inform the general public on the incident in Ebenebe, Awka North LGA that it was not informed. “On the Ndingbu village, Nnewi-North LGA, police have arrested some person aiding the ongoing investigation and has recovered a Toyota Camry used by the attackers. Operation is still ongoing aimed at rescuing the abducted and arresting the perpetrators to bring them to book.”
