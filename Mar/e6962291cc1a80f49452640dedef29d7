HighLife Who is a man of God? Is it a perfect person representing the interests of the Divine Being that made everything? Or maybe it is the imperfect person representing both his interests and those of his God? Your view would determine whether and how you accept gospel musician, Sammie Okposo, back to the limelight. It doesn’t look like he particularly cares for anybody’s acceptance. Okposo has started making attempts to return to the embrace of society. According to findings, the CEO of Zamar Entertainment announced that he is organising an audition for gospel musicians. The audition was held on March 23, 2022, at Zamar Entertainment office, Surulere, Lagos. The turnout was meh compared to what would have been, but that is nobody’s fault but the formerly trail-blazing minister. Okposo has not completely gotten out from under the shadow of shame that took the world by storm in February 2022. This was the incident that evolved from a lady’s narration that Okposo had gotten to know her biblically, gotten her pregnant, and then advised her (in no gentle tones) to get an abortion. Okposo is married to a lovely woman, everybody knows that. Thus, when the US-based women reported this, there was some hesitation over whether or not to believe the tale. But Okposo himself confirmed it. Then he went on to apologise to his wife with an Instagram post. Then he appeared to disappear from the limelight. And now, he is back. Nigerians do take a while to get over such things, especially when religion is involved. However, Okposo seems to have leapt over the gate of continuous public condemnation. This is good, as some have explained. After all, Okposo owes his God and conscience (his wife and vast following, also) the oath of faithfulness. But the man has regained his groove, and that matters too.
