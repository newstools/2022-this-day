 Hammed Shittu in Ilorin The National Secretary of Young Progressives Party(YPP), Hon. Vidiyeno Bamaiyi, has said the national leadership of the party would hit the target of 300, 000 membership in Kwara State before the 2023 general election in order  to wrest power from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Bamaiyi, who spoke with journalists in Ilorin, the state capital, over the weekend shortly after the supervision of the conduct of the state congress of the party held in Ilorin, said: “Already, the membership of the YPP in Kwara State is now over 60,000, and it will be increased before the next elections.” He said: “The increase in the membership drive of the YPP  in the state is borne out of the fact that the APC has allegedly failed in the delivery of campaign promises to the people that elected them into power. “Reports from the state secretariat of the party in Ilorin revealed that many members of the APC and PDP are defecting to the YPP so as to provide alternative leadership for the people of the state come 2023 elections. Bamaiyi, however, said the peaceful conduct of the party’s state congress through a consensus arrangement is in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act and the constitution of the party. In his acceptance speech, the new state Chairman of YPP, Chief Dele Ogunbayo, said he would not derail from the principles of the party while piloting it. He added that he would use his wealth of experience and wisdom to uplift the party to the greater height.
