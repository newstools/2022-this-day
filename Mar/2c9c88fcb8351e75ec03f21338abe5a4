WORLD CUP PLAYOFFS Interim Nigerian Coach, Augustine Eguavoen, said at the weekend that he hopes to lead the Super Eagles to victory against Ghana both in Cape Coast and Abuja on the way to this year’s World Cup in Qatar. Ghana will welcome arch-rivals Nigeria to Cape Coast on March 25 with the return leg four days later in Abuja. The overall winners of this match-up will march on to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar in November. Eguavoen fondly called Cerezo  insisted that Nigeria deserve to feature at the World Cup even though he does not expect the matches against the Black Stars to be easy. “It’s going to be a very tough game and a tight one as well,” he said. “We have a lot of mutual respect for one another, and when Ghana plays Nigeria and Nigeria plays Ghana, it’s always tough, it’s always tight. “But you see, it’s going to boil down to us trying to go there (Ghana). We will play everything we can to try to win the game, in fact, both games. “But with no disrespect, because Ghana is a very strong side, individually and collectively. We will just go and fight and try to win the game,” stressed the former Nigerian international. Both rivals last clashed in the semifinal of the 2010 AFCON in Angola with Ghana edging Eagles to reach the final courtesy of an Asamoah Gyan headed match winner.
