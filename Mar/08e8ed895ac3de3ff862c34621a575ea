 Chelsea are expected to be handed a full allocation of tickets for their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace next month. The Blues are currently banned from selling additional tickets to their fixtures as part of the sanctions imposed on current owner Roman Abramovich following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the Football Association has confirmed that there are ‘hopeful’ talks going on with the government which should allow an exception to be made for the game at Wembley. “We hope to have sell-out crowds at both of our Emirates FA Cup Semi Finals at Wembley Stadium,” a statement read. “This includes tickets for Chelsea supporters for their match against Crystal Palace and we are working with the government on a method to achieve this whilst respecting the sanctions that are currently in place on Chelsea.” Earlier on Monday, Julian Knight, the chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, called for Chelsea fans to be allowed to watch their team at Wembley. “Chelsea is more than just its owner, it’s a living organism with huge importance to its fans and community,” Knight said. “It was understandable that, at short notice, last week’s game against Middlesbrough went ahead without Chelsea fans. “But with this much notice, the FA have no excuse for excluding them. The FA must be allowed to sell tickets to Chelsea fans so long as all money goes to the people of Ukraine.” In the other semi-final Manchester City are taking on Liverpool. The build-up to this one has been controversial too, with fan groups from both clubs calling for the fixture to be moved from Wembley as there are no trains running to London on that weekend from either city. Despite this massive oversight from the organisers, the match does not currently appear likely to be moved.
