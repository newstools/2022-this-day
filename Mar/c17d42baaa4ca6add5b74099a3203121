HighLife   There are a thousand and one autobiographies about individuals who refused to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors. The results were always either too good to be true or too horrible to be possible. For the son of Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, Babajide Akeredolu, the steps of his predecessor make up the right way to glory. At the upper tiers of political and administrative power in Ondo today, there are only a handful of names that are worthy of note. Each of these names belongs to masters of the political game, individuals with decades and decades of experience jousting one another. And then from behind came Babajide, intent on making his mark and exceeding the ones that came before him. And he is succeeding in this venture. According to the most recent reports on the goings-on in Ondo, Babajide has inadvertently become the go-to guy. In other words, when you need high counsel or a push towards the brighter blocks of the bureaucracy, Babajide is just the right guy. For those who are a bit behind on the happenings in the Sunshine State, Babajide is the Ondo State Adviser and Director-General of the Performance and Project Implementation Monitoring Unit. He was sworn in by his father the governor a few months ago against an ocean of complaints and criticisms. Governor Akeredolu and some of those who supported the appointment defended it by pointing out the fact that Babajide cannot be more qualified for the position. As the faultfinders had nothing to say against Babajide’s qualifications, they declared that Babajide would lose any relevance in a few months, claiming that he would grow bored with the appointment and end up doing nothing for the state. It has been a few months since then and Babajide has only grown more popular with the people and more efficient in the dispensation of his duties. Much like his father.
