 MultiChoice Nigeria has announced an increase in the prices of its DStv and GOtv subscription packages. The company in a statement yesterday  said implementation of the new prices will take effect from April 1, 2022. According to MultiChoice, current economic realities in the country necessitate the price review and the adjustment will make it serve customers better. “In light of the rising costs of inflation and business operations, we have had to review the price of our packages to keep delighting our customers with great entertainment, anytime and anywhere,” the statement read in part. The company also said it has introduced incentives for customers to cushion the effect of the increase. “To cushion the price adjustment, we have made the following concessions: Customers who pay on or before the due date (April 1, 2022) will be eligible to pay the old price. If they pay consistently on time ( before their due dates) for a period of 12 months, they pay the old price. Customers who pay for 10 months upfront on the new price will get 11th and 12th months free,” it said. With the adjustment, premium DStv subscribers will pay N21,000 monthly while Compact + and Compact customers will pay N14,250 and N9,000 respectively. Other new DStv package prices include: DStv Confam N5,300; Yanga N2,950; Padi N2,150; Business N2,669 and Xtraview + PVR access fee N2,900. The new fee for Gotv subscriptions are: GOtv max N4,150, GOtv Jolli N2,800, GOtv Jinja N1,900 and GOtv lite N, 900. MultiChoice Nigeria is the Nigerian Subsidiary company of MultiChoice Africa, owner of DStv and GOtv.
