  Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Governor of Kano State, Dr.  Abdullahi Ganduje, has assured Nigerians that the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled to hold on March 26 will go ahead, saying reconciliation and consensus are already ongoing. For the last few days, the ruling party has been enmeshed in leadership crisis that almost threatened its convention. Now that peace appeared to be returning, Ganduje, who chaired  the Protocol Committee, said the party was preparing for the convention. Ganduje, while fielding questions from journalists at the party’s secretariat on Tuesday in Abuja, said: “We are preparing for the convention. Apart from the selection of about 250 able young men and women, they are undergoing training after which they will proceed to the Eagle Square, the venue of the convention. I will be there myself together with other members of the committee protocols subcommittee.” Baring his mind on a court order stoping the party from holding the convention, Ganduje noted that he had no fears that the convention would hold. According to him, “I have no fears. Our convention will hold, insh allah. Don’t worry, we are equal to the task. We are the biggest party in Africa and we have the experience to handle it. “We are organizing the convention, reconciliation is taking place, consensus is taking place and we believe we will give you the best.”
