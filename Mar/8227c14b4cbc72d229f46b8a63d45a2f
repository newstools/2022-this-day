 George Okoh In Makurdi The Benue State Chapter of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) has been tasked to mobilise Benue people for the electoral victory of the party in 2023 general elections. The National Legal Adviser of NNPP, Professor Bem Angwe, gave this charge on Monday at the inauguration of the elected members of the state executive of the party  in Makurdi, when he told members of the party to embark on door to door mobilisation of voters for the NNPP, which he said to represent the best alternative to take over governance in Benue in 2023. He noted that NNPP has come to rescue Benue and improve the living standard of the people who currently seemed to have lost hope as they battle with hunger, insecurity and general poverty. Angwe declared that with all structures in place at the state level, members should step up activities, preaching equity and justice and be open in their conduct. He remarked that there was no time to go criticising people and other parties  but party officials should use their energies to preach the need for a paradigm shift and not the usual rhetoric of shouting and talking down on others. He concluded that “hunger and poverty remain the dangerous weapons exploited to the disadvantage of the citizens. This must stop.” The 36 party’s executive committee has Group Capt Stephen Adah (rtd) as chairman, and Mr. John Tine as secretary.
