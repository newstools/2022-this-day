 The crisis rocking the Kaduna Polytechnic over the appointment of a new substantive rector has assumed a ridiculous dimension as the Governing Council recently recommended the Ag. Rector, Dr Suleiman Umar, for appointment as a substantive rector despite being probed by the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC). It could be recalled the polytechnic’s Governing Council, led by Senator Mohammed Mohammed, on November 17, 2021 had approved the extension of another six months for Dr Umar to serve on acting capacity; an action that violates the Polytechnic (Amendment) Act 2019 which forbids such extension. Of the three contenders submitted to the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu by the Governing Council, Dr Yahaya Saleh Ibrahim, who is the Provost of the College of Health Sciences, Kaduna State University (KASU), Makarfi Campus, came top, with an initial score of 71%. Unfortunately, there was an allegation that his score was reduced to 69% the second day. This brazen illegality should be quickly contained to make the process of appointing substantive rector rancour- free and more transparent. There is the need for minister of education, Malam Adamu Adamu to quickly wade into this impending crisis and resolve it once and for all. Musa Adamu Baba, Kaduna State
