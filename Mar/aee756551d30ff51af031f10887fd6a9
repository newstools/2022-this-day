Meanwhile, the Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has called on the federal government to synergise with his administration and step up military operations that will flush out armed herdsmen from neighbouring states bordering Benue. He said this will help end the invasion of Benue communities by killer herdsmen who have continued to use the porous nature of the state borders to invade hapless communities on the Benue side of the border.
