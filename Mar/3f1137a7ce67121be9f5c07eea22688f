Deji Elumoye in Abuja The 22 Governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have ruled out the possibility of shifting the March 26, 2022 date fixed for the national convention of the party notwithstanding the tight time frame provided by the time table of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) just released for next year’s general election.
The APC governors stressed this on Tuesday after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja.
