 Lionel Messi and Neymar were subjected to boos and jeers from Paris Saint-Germain fans yesterday in their first game since their dramatic Champions League collapse to Real Madrid last Wednesday. Lining up against Bordeaux in Ligue 1 on Sunday, both players were relentlessly booed by the home supporters and their every touch jeered. Kylian Mbappe — likely to move to Real Madrid on a free transfer in the summer — escaped the home fans’ wrath. At one point in the first half, the home fans booed as Messi and Neymar stood over a free kick, only to sarcastically cheer when Neymar hit his effort over the bar. Mbappe then put PSG 1-0 ahead on 24 minutes and the home support cheered his goal. Neymar then made it 2-0 after 52 minutes, but he was then roundly whistled and did not celebrate his goal. PSG won the match 3-0 against the league’s bottom club to move 15 points clear at the top and continue their march toward the Ligue 1 title. PSG’s “Ultra” group, the Collectif Ultras Paris, released a statement on Twitter ahead of the match, blasting the club’s direction. “Our Paris Saint-Germain deserves people who serve it, not people who are served by it. Against Bordeaux on Sunday, we will show our displeasure and we ask everyone who loves this club, who will be present, to unite with our non-violent action,” it read.
