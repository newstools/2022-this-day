 Rebecca Ejifoma Fire gutted Apongbon bridge and container-laden vehicles in Apongbo area of Lagos after inferno erupted in shops under the bridge Wednesday. The fire, which was said to have started at about 7am, affected shops selling baking materials. The Acting Coordinator, South-West Zonal Office of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Mr Ibrahim Farinloye, confirmed the fire outbreak. He noted that NEMA received a distress alert at 6am. The Federal and State Fire Service men were deployed. “There are lots of containers stored with different types of goods that are exploding, making access very difficult for firemen,” he bemoaned. While the Federal Ministry of Works has been urged to close the bridge, Farinloye added that they would carry out integrity tests to determine the safety of the bridge for further usage. Meanwhile, motorists have been urged to use alternative routes. Vehicular movements from Ikorodu Road are diverted to jibowu to connect Yaba to Oyingbo or Adekunle, from there to Adeniji towards Ebutte Ero or continue movements toward CSM or inner Marina. “Second route for those going to Ijora, Constain or inner part of Surulere can continue with the crawling movement to connect Eko bridge take a detour to Ijora and continue journey to Apapa or towards Leventis, UBA roundabout connect Marina Marina,” the NEMA Coordinator implored.
