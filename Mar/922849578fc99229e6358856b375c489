 Chief Executive Officer, MTN Nigeria, Karl Olutokun Toriola has charged the Nigerian Super Eagles to make the country proud. He urged the team to clinch a ticket to the FIFA 2022 World Cup after the Super Eagles played a goalless draw in the first leg of the qualifier against Ghana at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium in Kumasi, Ghana. The Ghanaianswere the more dangerous side, dominating possession for large parts of the game, but the Eagles’ defence stood resolute with fine performances from Francis Uzoho and Leon Balogun. Ahead of the return leg on March 29, 2022, the MTN CEO urged the team to make the nation proud. “The tie is finely poised, and we have all to play for in the return leg. We are relentlessly backing our Super Eagles to clinch the qualification ticket. The entire nation is behind them and we are also rooting for them,” Toriola said. Recall that in September 2021, MTN Nigeria, signed a three-year agreement with the NFF valued at 1.5billion Naira to become the Official Communications Partner of the Super Eagles and other national teams.
