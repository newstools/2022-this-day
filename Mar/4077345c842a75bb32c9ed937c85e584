When it comes to an industry like construction, one must admit that there is no one correct way or method. The industry borders on the arts and sciences but is one of the most practical of profitable sectors in Nigeria. Thus, it is no surprise that Olalekan Adebiyi, the brain behind LaraLek Ultimate Constructions Limited, is doing far more than his peers in the same industry. Historians who attempt to trace the spark and brilliance of the company that has come to be the number one construction company in Nigeria’s South-west region will find that it began with a humble man, Adebiyi. They will also be astonished to find that Adebiyi’s status might have exploded to cover the West African patch, but the man remains modest and unassuming. Even so, nobody will deny that Adebiyi’s mark is all over the road construction projects from Lagos to Ogun, Oyo to Osun, and Ekiti to Ondo states. But it all started in Lagos when Adebiyi worked hand-in-hand with former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. Similar to the present, Lagos bubbled amongst its peers on account of its well-constructed roads. However, the end of Ambode’s reign did not douse the flames that are Adebiyi’s reputation for good work. At present, some analysts report Adebiyi as having taken over the entirety of the South-west and gradually stretching towards its environs. This is understandable especially since the Ogun State government tested Adebiyi’s LaraLek Constructions with many road projects and found the company to be A-Grade. Truly, to have Adebiyi working on any road project in any state in Nigeria is a done deal. This is the reputation that is cast in gold, a reputation for the best work possible, in record time and warranting zero regrets.
