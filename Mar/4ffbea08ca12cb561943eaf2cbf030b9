The Delta State Commandant of NSCDC, Mr. Akinsanya Iskilu Abiodun, made the disclosure yesterday while parading the suspects at the command’s headquarters, Asaba. Abiodun said that the suspects were arrested by 181 Amphibious Battalion, Ughelli, due to robust synergy and collaboration by the two agencies.
