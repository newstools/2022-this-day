 The Social Democratic Party of Nigeria (SDP), was the big party in Nigerian politics leading up the 1993 elections. Most political bigwigs today were members of the SDP, founded in 1989.The ideology was clear. It was poised to be a Centre-left party with an emphasis on the development of the People. Hence the campaign mantra in the 93 elections was farewell to poverty; it had a lot of people-oriented programs and after the annulment of June 12, 1993 elections and return to democracy most of its members morphed into the PDP. Some still argue that PDP was a continuation of SDP then. The SDP has been punching below its weight but with this very volatile 2023 campaign season, some posit that the SDP might become the new political bride. It is public knowledge that the political space is crowded this season and they are too many political juggernauts but the sad reality is that getting ticket at the two major parties will be a fight to finish, as the PDP is currently fighting a zoning crisis and the APC is bedeviled by internal fighting which some claim is because of the vice-presidential aspiration of a certain player in the APC. As all of this crisis continues, political watchers are already looking at the SDP becoming a strong force in the 2023 elections. Some believe that SDP, is receiving a lot of overtures already. Recently Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso moved his structure to the NNDP, and it is also certain he will be on the presidential ballot for the first time. There are predictions already that the 2023 race might be a replica of the 1979 elections with all the gladiators running for office. In the coming months, the role of the SDP will become clearer.
