A medical report signed by the management of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) shows that the boy is currently on anti-failure medication. It further implores Nigerians to accord him necessary assistance. Ramadan was initially admitted at LASUTH 10 months ago, the medical report reveals. He was centrally diagnosed with oxygen saturation values in room air between 77.45 per cent. Examination of the cardiovascular systems revealed, as stated in the report, shows that a heart rate of 135bmp with a prude 3/6 pansystolic murmur loudest at the left lower sternal border. It concludes that echocardiography was done on 6th January 2021. Ramadan is said to have three holes in the heart – Secundum ASD, right partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and moderate PAH. It further stated that he was presented on account of recurrent chest infections noticed from birth. The patient’s mother, Tolani Mayaleke, bemoaned that she had been facing endless difficulties since she gave birth to Ramadan. Meanwhile, after LASUTH told Mayaleke last November that her son was due for the operation, she turned to the public for financial help to save her son. “I’m pleading to everyone to help me. I don’t want to lose my son. Please help me,” she lamented. The surgery is meant to be held in Nigeria at Babcock University Teaching Hospital.
