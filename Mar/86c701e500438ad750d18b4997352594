 Segun James The Lekki Concession Company (LCC), the operators of the Lekki and the Lekki-Ikoyi Toll Gates are to resume operation at Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge on April 1, 2022. The company, in an advertorial in a national newspaper and signed by the Managing Director, Yomi Omomuwasan, said  that the resumption of tolling followed several consultations with all parties and critical stakeholders affected by the tolling operations. This is coming about 18 months after tolling was suspended at the bridge following the aftermath of protests against police brutality and extrajudicial killings in Lagos State in October 2020. Although Omomuwasan was silent on the Lekki tollgate operation, he, however, announced that commuters plying the corridor will not be paying any toll for the first two weeks until 15th April 2022. He said that resumption of tolling at the bridge is coming after extensive consultations with stakeholders including the residents associations, traditional rulers, community leaders, professional bodies as well as the Lagos State Government. “We have introduced new technology and innovations to make passage at the toll plaza seamless and faster for commuters. We are replacing the old toll device with upgraded ones for faster throughput at the toll plaza. “The new devices have been configured to synchronise with the newly upgraded tolling systems and will improve functionally while enabling a better experience at the toll plaza,” the LCC boss said in the announcement. Following the LCC’s announcement that it consulted the state government, all efforts to confirm the new situation proved abortive as both the State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso and the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Gboyega Akosile refused to pick their calls and did not respond to short test messages sent to their phones.
