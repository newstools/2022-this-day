 Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki Uburu Community in Ebonyi State yesterday held a solidarity rally in support of the presidential ambition of Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi. The event attracted top government functionaries, community leaders and youths who marched on Okposi-uburu road in the state. Speaking at the event, the President of Uburu Town Union, Ugochukwu Ekpa, noted that Umahi is the best contestant to address the myriads of challenges facing the country. He noted that the court judgement which sacked Gthe governor and his deputy was unconstitutional, and cannot stand in superior courts. According to him, “We are here to declare total support for the presidential ambition of our son and leader, David Umahi for 2023. His presidential ambition will be fruitful, and we are here to tell Nigerians that we are fully in support. His coming as the president of Nigeria will address all the challenges facing our dear country. “The essence of this rally is to pledge our solidarity that is unshakable, immovable to our dear son Umahi. And I want to say this because I know the whole world is watching us. This is an impromptu rally and you can see the crowd to support our governor. “We are not here to discuss court judgment because it is prejudice to start discussing what is in court, but one thing is certain, when God says yes, nobody can say no! One thing is certain; God is not an author of confusion. God is the finisher, the beginning, and the end, and God does not lose his own and surly they will gather but because the gathering is not of God, they will scatter. “We have challenged the Facebook people to come out physically. Come and do your rally, if you do it successfully, we would know you are in charge. They are in Abuja-those disgruntled Facebook elements dishing out falsehood. But one thing I know is David Umahi is still onboard as the governor of this state.”
