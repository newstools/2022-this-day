 Kasim Sumaina in Abuja The federal government on Wednesday clarified that the preferred bidder for the proposed ‘Nigeria Air’ has nor emerged, adding that government is yet to select or appoint either entity or individual as preferred bidder for the project. Government, through the Ministry of Aviation, made this known in a statement made available to the press in Abuja. According to the statement signed by the Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Aviation, James Odaudu, “Our attention has been drawn to reports in some media to the effect that Qatar Airways has been chosen as the preferred bidder for Nigeria’s national carrier, ‘Nigeria Air’. “The report, coming just two days after the issuance of a Request For Proposal, which was published in local and international news media, is not only false but capable of discrediting the process for the establishment of the airline, and discouraging interested parties.” It statement further read: “We wish to state that throughout the process leading to the publication of the Request for Proposal, the guiding principle has been transparency and accountability which we promised will remain till the final delivery of the project, and by which we stand. “We wish to state categorically that no corporate entity or individual has been appointed or selected, or even preferred for the project as the process for selection has just started with the Request for Proposal. “All interested partners and the public are therefore advised to discountenance the report and proceed with their proposals as we assure them of our unalloyed commitment to transparency and accountability till the end of the process. “Our driving force is the commitment of the Buhari administration to bequeath to the country a national carrier that Nigerians would be proud of, and our determination and  commitment to it remains stoic. Finally we wish to appeal to media practitioners to always confirm information from the right quarters before going to press so as to avoid misleading the public.”
