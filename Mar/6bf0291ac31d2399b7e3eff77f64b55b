Innocent Megbolu Boycott, featuring Nollywood veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo (RMD), in a love tale of a terrorist, will hit cinemas nationwide on March 11. The blockbuster, which is an Ugochinazom productions and Green Neighbourhood films, chronicles the life of Yusuf who is pressured to join a terrorist group to save his dying daughter after he lost his father to the same illness. Things soon took a new twist after he loses his head over the daughter of Alhaji Biu (their bankroller) during a cleansing procedure observed before even suicide mission. Now everyone – the guerilla group, the sponsor, and the police – wants him dead for varying reasons. At the premiere in Lagos, the Producer and Director, Standfame Ajalaja Stanley, recounted how he fell head over heels when he got the script. “I love the story and the fact that love can come from any angle. And the story actually gives me this feeling that love happens anyway. With its settings in Lagos, Port-Harcourt, and Abuja, the producer said they were particular about the cast. He expressed: “We picked actors that we visualised could give us what we wanted, and it was based on credibility.” For Ifeanyi Ogeroluje, who plays a politician, Boycott is a film that will positively impact Nigerian society. He believes that Boycott is the antidote to the many ills in society. “Crime doesn’t do anybody good. So it’s a lesson that once you are a criminal it is high time you turned a new leaf. Embrace peace and love.”
