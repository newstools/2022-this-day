Society Watch When you are good at what you do, you will always be recognized and placed high among your peers. So it was for the very enterprising and officious Dele Phillips, a real estate player and hospitality business guru when he bagged the Outstanding Businessman and Inspiring Leadership Award at the fourth Timeline Awareness Initiatives/Award that held at The Sheraton Hotels, Ikeja Lagos. This year’s edition which had ‘Imperative of Harmonised Working Relationship between Arms of Government’ as its theme, had many distinguished personalities in attendance. Phillips, according to the organisers, was recognised and awarded based on his exemplary business sagacity and leadership qualities, which have severally and individually distinguished him from his peers over the years. The very focused and well-intentioned businessman is a native of Aramoko in Ekiti State. He owns the Shores Group that has in its stable the Shores Hotel and Restaurant and Lounge, both in Lekki and Victoria Island, and also the Shores Resort, at the Free Trade Zone, which is ongoing at the moment.
