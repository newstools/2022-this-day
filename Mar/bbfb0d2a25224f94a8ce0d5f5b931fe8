HighLife  From the way things are going in Nigeria, it wouldn’t be too fantastic to declare 2022 as a year for new things, new achievements, and breakthroughs, considering the many milestones that the country’s super business people have begun erecting. Take Aliko Dangote’s new fertility plant, for example. That single project has established the man as the biggest employer of labour in the country. But more than that, the project is a sure guarantee that more youths are going to stop dusting their school certificates as they trudge through dusty streets for work. President Muhammadu Buhari recently inaugurated the Dangote Fertilizer Plant in Lagos a few days ago. Speaking on the plant, Buhari said that Nigeria will not have to depend on multinationals and the generosity of foreign nations for the development of its agricultural sector. Now that there is a fertilizer plant, the possibility of exporting these products to the United States, Brazil, India, etc., is very high. Indeed, Dangote’s establishment of the plant is a big opportunity for growth on every side. Regarded as Africa’s largest Granulated Urea Fertilizer complex, the plant will be a source of employment for Nigerians and also a source of pride. Dangote has been making moves to revolutionise Nigeria’s economy. In February 2022, he was joined by the Kano and Kaduna State governments as he announced the partnership of his company with Stellantis Group, the parent company of car-making multinational, Peugeot. From then on, there have been calculations on end about how many Nigerians will be employed in the Peugeot-assembling factory in Nigeria. Indeed, in terms of the provision of employment opportunities, Dangote is ahead of his peers in Nigeria and Africa. He should be the model used for the encouraging phrase that we rise by lifting others.
