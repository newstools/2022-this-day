HighLife  The limelight in Nigeria is a relatively tiny spot that takes getting used to. For the majority of influential business personalities, investors and philanthropists, the spot is still as glamorous as ever. But for others, and here we mention Mas’ud Bashir Rahamaniya, the limelight is best left to others. But what we want for ourselves and what other people want for us are hardly ever the same. And so it is that despite trying not to, Rahamaniya, the MD of Al-Mas’ud Oil and Gas, has continued to remain so socially relevant to fellow Nigerians that there are calls for him to take up a political mantle and lead his people to greatness. When the proud people of Sokoto gang up on you and ask that you lead them in one capacity or another, that is great evidence that there is more to you than meets the eye. And it is clear that with Rahamaniya, there is much more to him than what is obvious from his many business exploits. It is generally agreed that Sokoto is an incredible place with a mostly homogeneous population that has very strong opinions about everything and anything. Yet, recent reports from there have it that many well-to-do and not-so-well-to-do individuals and groups have begun clamouring for Rahamaniya to contest for the 2023 governorship seat in the state. One well-known businessman who is a native of Sokoto allegedly stated that Rahamaniya’s vision, diligence, and strength of character are just what the Sokoto people need to take the next evolutionary step towards sustainable growth and development. Moreover, they want him to run for governorship under the aegis of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), an indication that the continuity of the current political landscape is preferred over changes. Regardless of the nuances of their choice, it seems as if Sokoto people have their eyes on Rahamaniya. And what can a man do but accept? Nevertheless, the limelight again has the super businessman and philanthropist in its radiant embrace.
