 Nigerian international, Kelechi ‘SeniorMan’ Iheanacho, was singled out for praise yesterday by Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers as the Foxes snatched a 1-0 win against Leeds at home. Iheanacho, who came in as a substitute, set up Harvey Barnes for the winning goal in the 67th minute. Speaking to LCFC TV after the game, Rodgers acknowledged the fact that it was a tough game and he commended Iheanacho for his contribution. “It was a really tough game for us today,” Rodgers said yesterday. “We know Leeds physicality and how they run and how they work, but I thought the players showed a great amount of courage. “Again we had to adjust the players, playing out of position. “Hamza came in to play at right back, but we kept fighting,we kept working. Kasper made some good saves, we missed some chances, but then we showed a real moment of quality in the game to win. “I thought collectively, the players defended well when they had to.” “Kels (Kelechi Iheanacho) does really well, because he offers himself for the bounce pass and then Harvey does what he does greatly. “He’s really becoming a good finisher, and he finished it really well.” Elsewhere, Sadio Mane’s first-half goal was enough to give Liverpool 1-0 victory over West Ham at Anfield and move them up to 63 points from 27 games, three points adrift of Premier League leaders Manchester City.
