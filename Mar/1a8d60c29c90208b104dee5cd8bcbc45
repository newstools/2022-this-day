It is important that the Committee work as one to lead the Party to greater victories and deliver good governance to Nigerians” the Ile-Ife born politician said. He went further to appeal to everybody within the party to cooperate with the leadership and appealed to those who stepped down to see their sacrifices as  a necessity for greater good of all and that the new leadership must initiate reconciliation mechanisms as a matter of priority to make the party stronger and better. “While we all know that the onus of healing and unifying the party now lies with the leadership of the party, it is also important that we see ourselves as a family with no victor nor vanquished, we all won together. I wish you all a successful tenure of office,” Omoworare said.
