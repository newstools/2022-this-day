It will not be out of place to say that billionaire businesswoman and architect, Princess Offiong Ekanem Ejindu, knows the ABC of doing business in and outside the country. Princess Fifi Ejindu, as she is popularly referred to by friends and loved ones, is blessed with the proverbial Midas touch, as everything she touches turns into gold. An architect of repute, Ejindu, who is the first African woman to be awarded a BA degree in Architecture at the prestigious Pratt Institute, commands respect whenever she steps out. No celebrity reporter that knows his or her onion would miss her appearance at an event. It is simply unacceptable. The very intelligent, well-educated and strikingly beautiful is highly connected and oozes style and class. Sometime in 2012, this super-angelic cosmopolitan woman held a fairy tale birthday party in the world’s only seven-star hotel at the Burj Al Arab. It was the first known Nigerian party at the hotel at that time. It was another beautiful moment that further showcased that she holds the ace when it comes to style and sophistication. It was an earth-shaking party, even her ‘enemies’ admitted that she is indeed the master of the game. To date, the party is still on the lips of those who were privileged to have witnessed it then. Before the Dubai party, the Princess had staged one of the most prestigious weddings by any Nigerian in London, 2001 at the prestigious Cathedral in West London and the iconic Dorchester Hotel, venue for the reception. Interestingly, again, the beautiful style icon is ready to pull another Hollywood-style party for her 60th birthday in May. Hold your breath! The details are yet to be made public, it was gathered that the birthday party will be held on one of the most beautiful beaches in Central American countries. Surely, this will   dwarf previous parties.
