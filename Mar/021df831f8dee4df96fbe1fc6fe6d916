‘ There is no doubt that legendary singer popularly known as ‘The Elegant Stallion,’ Onyeka Onwenu is an interesting personality as she is delectable. Since star actress, Vicky Nwogu encountered her, it has been one form of praise or the other on the celebrated and eloquent singer who recently clocked 70. Speaking with so much admiration on Onwenu, Nwogu said: “I could have easily fainted out of excitement the first day I met legendary Onyeka Onwenu on the ÍJÈ AWÉLÉ movie set. Staying close to her and having long conversations with her made me learn a lot of life lessons, with further understanding that legends are also human beings, having a personal knowledge of her choices in life and decisions which all came together to make her who she is. ”It’s safe to say Onyeka Onwenu is one mentor she will be keeping for the long run. Their film together is set to be released in May. We certainly look forward to what they’ve been cooking up for us, we hear it borders around child molestation.
