 Olawale Ajimotokan Women Agro Processors, Agricgen and Exporters Initiative (WAPAGEIN) has decried multiple port levies, high tariffs and double taxation at the ports, saying they are militating against export business in Nigeria. The president of the association, Mrs Esther Adebayo, made the outcry yesterday in Abuja at the launching of WAPAGEIN and the flag off of the National Export Centre. She said that rather than decongesting the ports, the federal government should modernise the ports and end the plain extortion from illegal taxes, which do not go in to the coffers of the federal authority. She also said ports should be for facilitating business and exports and stimulating industrial manufacturing and competitiveness of local business and exports and not for equipment revenue generation. Adebayo said the cost of exporting 100 tons of cargo in the country is $35,000 compared to $4000 in Ghana. “Today the leading ports for West Africa are in Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo and Benin Republic. All these countries have modernised their port management systems, leaving Nigeria far behind. The federal government should increase the training and employment of extension workers and other supportive services to boost increase in agricultural production,” she said. In his remarks, the FCT Minister, Muhammed Musa Bello, said it was heartwarming and worthy of emulation that women considered it necessary and timely to network and engage themselves in such a gainful and transformational stride. The minister, who was represented by the FCT Permanent Secretary, Mr Olusade Adesola said agriculture is critical to human existence and a reliable means of livelihood. He also lauded WAPAGIEN for aligning their agro vision with the economic and agro-business policies of the federal government. He expressed belief that the project will provide and enhance a veritable platform for mutual interactions and partnership between the women business group and various agencies of government.
