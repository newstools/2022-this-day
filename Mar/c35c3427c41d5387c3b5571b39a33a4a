Society Watch In Yorubaland, the title Agbaoye is never given to a Lilliputian or a man of little means. It is an honour reserved only for a well-respected, highly influential, powerful, well-connected and extremely wealthy man. This certainly explains why billionaire businessman, Orikolade Ayodele Karim aptly fits into that description. When the race for the new Agbaoye of Ibadanland commenced last year, shortly after the death of the former holder of the title, Chief Harry Akande, it was so intense. For more than a month, the seemingly tortuous search for a fitting replacement, who must be very wealthy, powerful, influential and well connected, had gone on. But at last, after wider consultations, Karim, a shipping magnate and stupendously wealthy boss of Shoreline Natural Resources clinched it. The date for the coronation was fixed by the then monarch, His Imperial Majesty Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji. During the ceremony, the international business magnate showcased how well connected and influential he is, as the event that was held on April 3, 2021, literally shook the ancient city of Ibadan to its very foundation. Interestingly, since he was installed, the high-flying globally recognised mogul has not disappointed his people. There is no gainsaying that the polo-loving Karim truly loves his hometown given his level of participation in the socio-political development of the ancient city of Ibadan. Society Watch gathered that he has been a good ambassador of the ancient city and continues to represent what it stands for. A source disclosed that Karim is a role model to many young ones in his hometown as he has once again restored their hopes in their roots.
