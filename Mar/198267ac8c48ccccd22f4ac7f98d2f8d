  For the second time, Nollywood filmmaker Ike Nnaebue is mentoring international students on how to make films the Nollywood way. Last year, he had a session with students of Bournemouth University which ended in a virtual co-production. This year, the students of Film Academy Baden-Württemberg in Germany will be benefiting from his vast knowledge. “My program with the students already started with the screening of my new film ‘No U-Turn’,’’ he said. “I will be mentoring the students as they try to make a short film here in Lagos the Nollywood way. It’s an exchange program so this means the German students have some Nigerian film students joining in the training and mentorship.” For Nnaebue, he has always been fascinated by the exchange of cultures and mindsets. “Aside from the fact that I enjoy sharing my experiences and the skills I’ve picked up in over 20 years of  working in the industry, teaching international film classes is also an exciting research process for me.” In 2021, Nnaebue embarked on a journey to his past as he relives his migration ordeal  to Europe by land. The creative product of that experience ‘No U-turn’ was applauded at the recently held Berlinale International Film Festival. It is yet to debut in Nigeria.
