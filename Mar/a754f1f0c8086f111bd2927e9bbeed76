 Francis Sardauna in Katsina The management of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has debunked allegations that all customers in Katsina State are expected to be paying N27,275.47 as their monthly electricity bills from February 2022. KEDCO, in a statement issued to THISDAY on Monday by its Head of Corporate Communications, Ibrahim Sani Shawai, described the allegations as false. A media outlet had reported that KEDCO had increased its monthly charges for customers in Katsina State to N27,275.47 with effect from February this year. But Shawai, in the statement, said: “This is false and we wish to put in proper perspective that the information as published in one of the online news outlets does not represent the position of KEDCO. “The information as published by the news outlet was only a reply to one of our customers’ letters and does not in any way address other customers’ consumption. “Based on the explanation in our response letter to the said customer, the said customer’s increase in bill was as a result of the increase in supply to 22 hours as well as change of band from C to B.” According to him, “We want to put it straight that some customers in Katsina were billed less than N10,000 in the month of February.” While urging the general public to disregard such publication, Shawai admonished media outlets to stop “misrepresentation of facts in order to serve certain interests”.
