Given this performance Thomas has called on Nigerians to report underwriting companies that fail to pay genuine claims to policyholders as and when due. Thomas, said there was an urgent need to rewrite Nigerians’ poor perception about insurance to increase uptake of insurance products. He disclosed that the Commission was planning to start ranking insurance firms based on the number of claims filed and settled yearly. The Commissioner lamented that though the industry was moving ahead in claims payments, the activities of some operators remained a task. He said, “Claims payment has always been one aspect the industry has been battling with. We all agree that we cannot claim ignorance of the fact that the industry is paying huge claims even though activities of a few amongst the operators are jeopardising the efforts of the majority. We had before now, agreed to start ranking companies on the number of claims received and settled every year and we intend to make the ranking a public knowledge for the insurance consumers. It is always an issue that puts the entire industry on the edge.” He explained that the commission has been implementing various market developmental initiatives to lift the insurance sector to a global standard through risk-based supervision framework, digital capabilities and others.
