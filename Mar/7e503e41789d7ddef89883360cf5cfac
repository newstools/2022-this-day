 Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has handed over 253 cartons of seized animal drugs to the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) in Katsina State. The acting Comptroller of the Katsina Area Command of the NCS, Dalha Wada Chedi, while handing over the drugs to the agency, said the drugs were seized from smugglers across the state. He explained that the seized animals’ drugs included 103 cartons of Dalloxy 5%, 144 cartons of Tylosin 600mg and six cartons of Dallimulti, totaling 253 cartons. He, however, expressed dismay over the patronage and consumption of unregistered, hard and expired drugs among Nigerians, saying it has consequences on the teeming youths across the country. He said: “Most criminal acts are carried out under the influence of these hard drugs; we will continue to stop it at all cost. I urge the public to continue to cooperate with us so as to insulate the economy from smugglers and protect people’s health.” Chedi assured Nigerians that the customs service would continue to carry out its enforcement duties with utmost professionalism and caution, based on actionable intelligence information. Receiving the drugs on behalf of NAFDAC, Bashir Lawal Yarima said the agency would carry out further investigation to ascertain the genuineness of the drugs.
