 Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has warned that the livestock industry in the country might soon go bankrupt as a result of banditry, cattle rustling, kidnapping and the activities of many outlawed groups operating across the country that always attack, maim, or kill pastoralists without any just cause. The warning was contained in a communiqué issued yesterday in Abuja, by the socio-cultural organisation at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting with its electoral committee members.The communiqué was signed by National President of MACBAN, Alhaji Hussein Bosso and National Secretary Baba Ngelzarma. The meeting held at the National Mosque, Abuja, on Friday had in attendance chairmen and secretaries from the 36 states and Abuja and one Ardo from each state as well as the representative of the Sultan of Sokoto, representative Emir of Kano, representative Emir of Zazzau, and representative Emir of Katsina. The breeders expressed serious concerns over the continuous displacement of thousands of pastoralist families as a result of cattle rustling, banditry and other forms of insecurity across the country. The association vowed to give maximum support to government and security agencies to deal with the outlaws and bandits. It also decried the excessive use of force on innocent pastoralists by security agencies and the confiscation of their livestock in the guise of arresting criminals, saying security men should be restrained from going overboard in discharge of their duties. MACBAN also said it was concerned that the enactment of anti-open grazing laws by some states in southern parts of the country amounted to placing economic sanctions and social warfare against pastoralist livelihoods.It expressed appreciation to the Sultan of Sokoto for showing support regarding the plight of pastoralists in the country and assured that it would do whatever it takes to restore dignity and address issues affecting pastoralists with all the seriousness it deserves. It also urged the Sultan to summon a Fulbe National Conference involving pastoralists leaders, the Fulbe intelligentsia and other critical stakeholders to address the issues of insecurity, economic empowerment and the negative media profiling of Fulbe in most of the national social and mainstream media.
