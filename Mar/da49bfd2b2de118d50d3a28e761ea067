 Following the announcement last year of its plans to train 300,000 young Nigerians under its film and television production e-learning program in collaboration with Mastercard Foundation’s Young Africa Works, KAP Academy has now opened calls for entries. The initiative is part of Mastercard Foundation’s goal to enable 30 million young people, particularly young women across Africa, to access dignified work. Announcing the call for applications in a statement, the academy owned by famed filmmaker Kunle Afolayan said that application is open to young men and women between the ages of 20 and 35 across Nigeria, and is targeted at people passionate about film and television production. Afolayan emphasized that the selection process will take into consideration a gender balance ratio to allow for adequate participation of women. e noted that 40 per cent of candidates to be selected would be drawn from young women and men from low-income backgrounds. Successful programme applicants will become the first set of beneficiaries in the training scheme that will formally commence in April 2022. “The academy is focused on growing the next generation of skilled filmmakers through the tutelage of veterans and film professionals who provide hands-on experience in diverse aspects of filmmaking to enrolled students,” he stated. The training will include ‘The Masterclass Series’ and two levels of certification from professional institutions in the areas of screenwriting, sound, editing, directing, cinematography and production design, among others, as well as practical hands-on training. The KAP Academy will be leveraging smartphone technology for the training as teaching will be conducted through a learning app. To ensure inclusivity, free tuition and smartphone devices will be offered to students from less privileged backgrounds as part of the support to ensure young people enrolled in the programme have access to the tools required for digital learning.
