 The fate of the Super Eagles to fly the Nigerian flag in the Qatar 2022 World Cup will be decided this evening beginning at 6pm. Sports entertainment platform, StarTimes, has promised to broadcast  the match live via NTA and other local channels in crystal-clear quality. Suspense, anxiety, tempers, hope or despair, or a combination of these, will be the aura among football-loving fans as history will be modified for both teams with strong rivalry. Following a goalless draw in Kumasi on Friday, the two teams will battle it out at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium. Ghana paced the pitch last Friday but Nigeria created more chances in a high-octane first leg. The West African football rivalry between Nigeria and Ghana started over 70 years ago, with 57 games between the two countries – the Black Stars (25 wins) and the Super Eagles (12 wins). The last time both countries were involved in a FIFA World Cup qualifying was in 2001 when they finished 0-0 in Accra and Nigeria swept aside their visitors 3-0 in Port Harcourt in July 2001 to qualify for Korea/Japan. Nigeria have been at every FIFA World Cup final since 1994, except the 2006 edition in Germany, and reached the Round of 16 in USA 1994, France 1998, and Brazil 2014. Home advantage may be to Nigeria’s advantage at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, with the Eagles to play in front of a capacity 60,000 fans after the Nigeria Football Federation secured a go-ahead from the Confederation of African Football for maximum capacity. Viewers at home can catch all the actions live on StarTimes as low as N90 pay-per-day subscription.
