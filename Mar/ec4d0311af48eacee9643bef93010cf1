I am grateful to God Almighty and the governor for giving me the opportunity to serve. “I also thank the people of our dear state for their support and encouragement which motivated me in the discharge of all the tasks and assignments given to me, especially with regards to the envisioned three gateways (land, air and sea) for the rapid development of our dear state and the creation of job opportunities for our enterprising youths. “Throughout the duration of my service, I strived diligently to interpret the governor’s vision for our state as encapsulated in the Divine Mandate Agenda and Completion Agenda respectively.” On his part, Ibuot was alleged to have resigned due to his opposition to the governor’s succession agenda.
