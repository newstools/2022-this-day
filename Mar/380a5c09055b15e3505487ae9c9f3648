 Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal,  President Muhammadu Buhari does not “understand” the dynamics of modern governance. Tambuwal yesterday said the relationship between the president and Nigeria is a “forced marriage”. Speaking at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) secretariat in Kaduna, the Sokoto governor accused the All Progressives Congress-led federal government of destroying the country. “We have seen that APC has not been able and cannot manage even their affairs as a party. How much more providing governance and leadership of a country as great, dynamic and complex as Nigeria? We know the crisis in APC today. “They will say ‘it is Abubakar Sani Bello today, tomorrow they will say it is Mai Mala Buni’. They are even confusing their supporters and members just the way they have succeeded in confusing the economy of this country. “I have said this somewhere else I will repeat it, the situation between President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigeria is like that of a forced marriage between a man and a woman. “There can hardly be understanding or peace. The president doesn’t understand Nigeria and the dynamics of modern governance.” Tambuwal said Nigeria needs a president who understands the country and can build consensus on matters of national importance. “For us to address Nigeria’s challenges today, we need to have at the top of leadership of this country someone that understands Nigeria itself. They have friends across the nook and cranny of this country,” he added. “They can reach out, consult and build consensus on matters and issues that concern the people of this country. You can only do that if you have the necessary network. “We need someone who can unify this country. Someone who is pan-Nigerian. Someone who understands the dynamics of governance and modern day governance of the 21st century.”
