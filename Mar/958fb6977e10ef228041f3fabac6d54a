 Emma Okonji MainOne, West Africa’s connectivity and data centre solutions provider, has expanded its fiber optic network infrastructure to the Lagos Free Zone in Lekki. MainOne, in partnership with the Lagos Free Zone, launched its fibre optic network infrastructure at the zone recently, in order to support businesses with fast speed broadband internet connectivity. Being the first private free zone in Nigeria, the Lagos Free Zone aims to be the preferred investment hub in Nigeria with best-in-class infrastructure, facilities and services. The launch of MainOne’s fibre network infrastructure at the Lagos Free Zone, came on the heels of the recent visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to launch the largest fertilizer plant in Africa at the Lekki Free Zone, where businesses are currently shifting to for expansion. MainOne’s fibre network infrastructure, which has already been deployed within the axis, is expected to support businesses that are currently springing up in the zone, with direct, reliable, and secure network connectivity with access to data centre services, allowing for increased productivity and network speeds of world-class standards. Speaking at the launch, the Chief Executive Officer of MainOne, Funke Opeke, said the hub powering the entire fibre network infrastructure at the Lagos Free Zone, has the capacity of 10 Gigabytes per second from day one, with plans to grow it to one Terabyte per second over the years as the number of businesses increase in the zone. She said MainOne invested heavily in the deployment of the fibre network infrastructure in the zone, which is a combination of multiple repeater towers, special licence radios, resilient radio links and fibre optic network connectivity. The Chief Technical Officer, MainOne, Anil Verma, said: “The partnership between MainOne and Lagos Free Zone will provide strategic value to forward-thinking businesses who seek to enjoy the ease of doing business. Organisations at the Zone will experience increased speed, security, and connectivity in ‘The New Frontier’ with MainOne. Customers will also enjoy access to local data centres and other local and global service providers through the MainOne data center with connections directly from the Zone.” The Chief Technical Officer, Lagos Free Zone, Nikhil Khandelwal, stated that the partnership with MainOne for the provision of high-speed fibre optic network at the Lagos Free Zone (LFZ), would provide an efficient technological backbone for spearheading our drive towards delivering enhanced ease of doing business to our tenants.
