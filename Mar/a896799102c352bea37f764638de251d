HighLife The life of a widow is not an easy one. The difficulties can be overwhelming for the average person, but with life and hope come endless possibilities. And so it is for Bunmi Tejuoso (formerly Ajisafe). After spending more than a decade in the shadows of widowhood, the light of new love has shone on her again, and the veils of matrimony are all around her. The friends and relatives of the widow of the late Prince Kunle Tejuosho, the son of Oba Adedapo Tejuosho, the Osile Oke Ona Egba, are pumping their fists in the air in excitement. This is because the bells of marriage have once again rung for Bunmi. Many people cast their hearts away in the event of death, but Bunmi has found another reason to live on, be strong, and shine with all the lights of life and beauty. Her marriage to the lucky groom, Jide Agbesanwa, took place on Thursday, February 24, 2022. Both the bride and groom glowed with that characteristic radiance of people in love. Even a passerby would have been able to tell that they complemented each other very well and were prepared to go the long haul. This is a blessing for Bunmi considering that she could not travel the distance of her first marriage since her husband, Prince Tejuosho, passed away in 2009 at 38. He left behind the lovely wife he had met, immediately fallen in love with, and wedded when she was still only a student at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. Over the years, Bunmi has also had to cater to the three children she had with her deceased husband. Nevertheless, with the new jingles of matrimony is a renewed chance at life. Also, considering that Bunmi’s light in the form of her philanthropic foundation, Tree of Life, never faltered in her widowhood, one can only expect a bursting forth in the future.
