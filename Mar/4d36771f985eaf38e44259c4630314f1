Rtn Olawuyi Abinibi President, Rotary Club of Ikeja GRA, said the clean-up programme is in furtherance of Rotary’s main objective which is service to humanity and that indiscriminate dumping refuse is not only illegal but dangerous to human health. In his own remarks, Rtn. Raheem Adebisi, President Of the Rotary Club of Mende Midtown noted that Rotary as a humanitarian service organisation prioritises service above self and that is why members trooped out en-masse to solve other peoples’ problems by making the environment clean. The President-elect of Rotary Club of New Lagos, Olumide Lawal noted that the group has done over 12 kilometres of waste cleaning, with over a hundred bags of waste generated through the efforts of about 80 Rotarians that participated in the programme.
