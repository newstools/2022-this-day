 Rising Nigerian singer Oyinkansola Sarah, popularly known as Ayra Starr received a standing ovation after delivering an outstanding performance at the official announcement of MTN Brand Refresh that was held recently. The Mavin princess achieved this accolade after she emerged on stage to give a live rendition of a medley of her songs: ‘Away’, ‘Beggie Beggie’, and ‘Bloody Samaritan’. Talented and bursting with youthful exuberance, her performance was reflective of MTN’s plans to accommodate the younger generation’s tech need as it transforms from a telco to a tech company. These changes appear in its new logo — a second brand overhaul in its history — and summarise its Ambition 2025, a three-year strategic plan to become the leading digital solution for Africa’s progress. According to the Chief Executive Officer, MTN Nigeria, Karl Toriola, MTN is committed to continuously creating value for all its stakeholders. The new logo contextualizes the company’s identity as a digital citizen that is open to change, young at heart, and progressive. Star-studded, the event had the likes of Uti Nwachukwu, former On-Air personality Gbemi Olateru, radio personality, VJ Adams in attendance.
