Forget her pedigree as the daughter of a Yoruba aristocrat and wife of a former Kwara State governor and immediate past President of the Senate, Toyin Saraki is one woman who will continue to remain relevant in our society for her brilliance and intellectual contributions to issues. Many will be amazed that three years after her family left the corridors of power, her relevance has not waned; rather, she has continued to soar. The Founder-President of Wellbeing Foundation Africa (WBFA) has never for once gotten tired of rendering humanitarian assistance to her immediate society. Also, she has continued to galvanise global partnerships and champion causes that attract global attention. Last week, the beautiful and slim-built mother of four received applause on social media when she expressed her frank opinion about some of the vices around the world: inequalities and discrimination. In a post, she penned these beautiful lines: “There is an urgent need to take action to end the inequalities and discrimination that persist around the world. As thousands of Nigerian and African students flee the war in Ukraine, there is a growing concern that non-Europeans have faced acts of discrimination and violence as they seek safety “Today on Zero Discrimination Day, we must raise our voices together to advocate for the right of everyone to live a full and productive life – with dignity. Now, more than ever, our world needs the dialogue of peace, inclusivity and compassion. This global movement for unity to combat discrimination must turn into tangible action. “Every human life is precious and deserves the same treatment and right to safe passage, regardless of their skin colour.” She further drummed support for Africans, saying, “We cannot turn our back on Africans who are being treated as third country and economic migrants, rather than what they are: refugees displaced by war. Everyone has the right to life, freedom, and safety.”
