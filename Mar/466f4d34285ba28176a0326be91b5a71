 Ferdinand Ekechukwu As far as 2022 goes, singer-songwriter, Timaya is intent on going back-to-back with smash hit singles as he releases yet another hit single with stirring Amapiano rhythm titled ‘Charger’.  This comes on the heels of his recently released 2022 debut inspirational single, “No Pressure”, which is currently enjoying massive airplay. Charger is the third single off Timaya’s next studio album titled “Chuloverse”.  Produced by Nigerian Amapiano powerhouse duo, Smeez & D3an, ‘Charger’ just like many of Timaya’s classics, effortlessly leaves listeners in awe. Just like ‘Cold Outside’ and ‘No Pressure’, ‘Charger’ is poised to earn millions of streams on multiple spots and top playlists worldwide. Timaya relies on modish Amapiano beat caressed by his unique, rhythmic vocals to score deserved points. This track leaves you no choice but to move your body as you groove to the beat. Call it a club banger and you’d be correct. The award-winning musician has released eight studio projects; True Story, Gift And Grace, De Rebirth, LLNP Long Life N Prosperity, Upgrade, Epiphany, Chulo Vibes EP and Gratitude 2020. Papi Chulo as he’s fondly called has won several notable awards and nominations including the Headies Awards, AFRIMMA Award, Nigeria Music Award, NEA Award, amongst others. His songs explore different genres, themes and ideas. ‘Charger’ was released on Wednesday 16 March, 2022 and is available on all streaming platforms. ‘Charger’ is great music that listeners will find irresistible to add to playlists!
