HighLife True politics, the art of state management and development, has to do with standing up for what is right. It is presenting oneself to be burned by public opinion if need be if only the people would be better as one. This is what Otunba Kayode Fasae (OKF) is set to accomplish with his political ambition to stand in for Ekiti South Federal Constituency 1 in the House of Representatives. Ekiti is a blessed state in Nigeria. Each senatorial district and federal constituency has brilliant people representing them at the top. It is consequently obvious that the people are continually chasing the goals of the whole rather than those of the self. No selfishness, one might conclude. And this is the case for OKF. It is generally believed that to know the true character of an individual, one only needs to observe how they have managed the role they have been given. For OKF, this position is the DG of Ekiti State Microfinance and Enterprise Development Agency (MEDA). This is the institution responsible for the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Ekiti State. As one might guess, OKF’s leadership at MEDA requires him to be very close to the innovative people of Ekiti. And so it is. OKF has greatly improved the conditions of SMEs in the state, helping to increase the access of their operators to needed resources and tools to ensure that there is a high degree of participation in the socio-economic growth and development process in Ekiti. Judging from OKF’s many accomplishments in MEDA, there is every likelihood that he is going to extend the same line of performance to the House of Reps position he is currently vying for. Can one think of a better person for the job? Surely not.
