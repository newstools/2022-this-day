Sunday Aborisade in Abuja A South-west pressure group, the Lisabi Progressives Union (LPU), Tuesday, reaffirmed its support for the All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmanship bid of Niger East Senator, Sani Musa. The leadership of the group, in a statement in Abuja, said that its position had not changed on their preferred choice of Musa as the right man for the national chairman of the APC.The group’s National President, Adeleke Lukman, who signed the statement on behalf of the union, said members of the progressives family were not swayed by media propaganda and deliberate misrepresentation of events.The LPU condemned the idea of swing stories of purported endorsement of a particular candidate by Mr. President to intimidate other candidates. Part of the statement read: “Today, we make bold to say that the purported endorsement of a particular candidate few weeks to national convention is laughable and only exists in the imagination of those who sought to achieve a sinister motive and further plunge our party into chaos. “Our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, is a democrat and would never be a part of such cheap charade.“We believe that all the aspirants contesting for the position of the national chairman of our great party are eminently qualified.“As such, we expect the candidates to campaign vigorously and consult with party leaders on their aspirations. “It makes a mockery of the entire campaign process when a candidate who was never in the race is now purportedly being foisted on other candidates who have put in the hard work to campaign legitimately within the provisions of our party’s constitution.“Our stand remains the same, recall that in August 2021, we prevailed on Senator Sani Musa to contest the vacant national chairmanship position of the All Progressives Congress.“Today, as a group, we’re happy that he heeded our call by purchasing and submitting his nomination and expression of interest form.”He also disclosed that members of the LPU have finalised plans to storm the Eagle Square, Abuja in their numbers, ahead of the APC national convention slated for March 26. He stated further that asides the massive support that the group is drumming for the emergence of Senator Musa, the delegates amongst them were battle ready to cast their votes for the Niger East senator and sway opinions of other delegates from Ogun State in his favour.
