HighLife They say that gold and other shining things are a lady’s best friend. What is to be said about the lady that provides access to these friends? This is why Otunba Folasade Adunni Adesoye, the Yeye Otunba Gbaderogun of Ijebu, is so popular among Nigerian ladies. Even after clocking 60 a few days ago, her sparkling reputation did not dim, nor did her attractive demeanour. There is a category of women in Nigeria whose names are written with golden letters. Adesoye is one of such women for the most obvious reason that she is a bestseller of all things jewellery. Her appropriately styled Jewelry Affairs has been making waves since it came to the forefront of the industry as a registered business in 2007. It was in 2007 that many Nigerians came to know of the damsel. In truth, she had been in the business of jewellery sales for two decades prior. This culminated in her gaining mastery of the trade, which is something rare. Even so, her blazing trail has left every person that knows her truly charmed. Many times, comparisons have been made between Adesoye and other brilliant and powerful women like oil and gas tycoon, Hajia Bola Shagaya. The similarity comes from the ageless charm that they exude. With Adesoye, you get that peerless charm with humility that beggars the question: is she really as wealthy as the papers make her out to be? And the answer is a resounding yes. But Adesoye is not like the wealthy people that most folks are familiar with: people that thumb their noses at others and throw a tantrum when someone with a smaller pool of funds looks sideways at them. All in all, at 60, Otunba Adesoye shines with the same glow as her jewellery.
