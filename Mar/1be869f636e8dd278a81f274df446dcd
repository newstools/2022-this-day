According to him: “The domestic economy this year has been doing reasonably well, coupled with the steady increase in global oil prices. “All these positive indicators have reflected in our stock market in the last two months. Things are looking less chaotic as everybody was anticipating this year and it is that optimism that is pushing the stock market high. “We have also seen impressive corporate earnings by listed companies. Companies such as Zenith Bank, Seplat, among others are paying a robust dividend to shareholders. It will be against the background of these developments that the stock market will not appreciate impressive earnings and economic growth.” On his part, the Managing Director, APT Securities and Funds Limited, Mallam Garba Kurfi, noted that the stock market in the last three years has not closed positive in two consecutive months. According to him quoted companies such as Dangote Cement Plc, MTN Nigeria, Airtel Africa and Zenith Bank Plc have appreciated, impacting on the overall stock market growth in the last months of 2022. He noted that impressive corporate earnings and proposed dividend by Seplat petroleum Plc Zenith Bank Plc, among others have boost investors’ confidence on listed stocks on the NGX. According to him: “Of course, in 2021, there was global COVID-19 pandemic that affected companies on the Exchange and movement of goods and services. However, this year, the virus has been tackled with discovery of vaccines and we have witnessed ease of movement that created room for businesses to thrive and improve on their performances.” Analyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye explained that most listed stocks were below their intrinsic value and discerning investors have been taking advantage of the cheap stocks. In its recent report titled: ‘Nigeria Outlook 2022,’ analysts at United Capital Plc had stated “We believe 2022 would be a year to target yields and in the case of equities, dividend yield. That said, we expect Q1, 2022 to remain fairly upbeat which presents investors with an opportunity to ride the momentum of positive corporate earnings and dividend announcements. “Subsequently, we believe maintaining a passive approach towards equity investment in subsequent quarters would be prudent, with a preference for high yielding debt instruments. That said, we do not believe it will be all doom and gloom, as we expect pockets of opportunities to show up due to factors such as special corporate actions, exceptional corporate performance and depressed valuations.”
