PREMIER LEAGUE  Arsenal cruised to a 2-0 win over Leicester City in the Premier League on Sunday, as goals from Thomas Partey and Alexandre Lacazette proved to be the difference between the sides. The Gunners started brightly, with Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli causing the Leicester backline numerous problems. And the Gunners got their just rewards in the 11th minute when Partey rose highest at the near post to head home a Gabriel Martinelli corner. The home side’s dominance continued thereafter, and Partey almost doubled their lead with a wonderful side-footed effort from the edge of the box, but the ball cannoned off the upright. Leicester finally started to show some signs of life around the half-hour mark, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Harvey Barnes starting to get on the ball a bit. The latter was denied the equaliser in the 35th minute by an astonishing save from Aaron Ramsdale, who was at full stretch to tip Barnes’ header round the post. Arsenal regained control at the start of the second half, running Leicester’s backline ragged. And the defence did eventually collapsed catastrophically as Caglar Soyuncu (who else?) stretched out a hand to block a Partey header, gift Arsenal a penalty, and get himself a yellow card. Lacazette stepped up to convert the resulting spot kick with aplomb – slamming it into the top left corner of the net. After going two down, Leicester’s heads clearly dropped and Arsenal took advantage. The victory moves Arsenal back up to fourth, one point clear of Manchester United in fifth – but the Gunners have three games in hand.
