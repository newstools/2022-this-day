The biggest game of the week will see league leader Real Madrid welcome Barcelona to Estadio Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday at 9pm on SuperSport La Liga. The Blaugrana have enjoyed a resurgence since the end of January, but they are not in a position to challenge for the title just yet. Nonetheless, Barca will hope that their January recruits -Adama Traore and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang continue their fine form. “He has scored goals all his career. He gets into space well. He is mature, intelligent, humble, and positive,” said Barcelona manager Xavi of the Gabonese striker. Real boss Carlo Ancelotti, meanwhile, is hoping his team shrugs off their penchant for slack performances in the first half of games: “It cost us to go into the games with the necessary intensity, it’s a soft spot that we have had and we are going to fix it,” said the Italian. Fresh from knocking Manchester United out from Europe, Champions Atletico Madrid faces a tricky match against neighbours Rayo Vallecano today at 9pm on SuperSport La Liga.
