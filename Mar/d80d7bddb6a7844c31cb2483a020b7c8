According to analysts at Cordros securities: “We expect investors to take advantage of the significant moderation in the share prices to make a re-entry in dividend-paying stocks in the week ahead. “However, we envisage a zig-zag pattern as intermittent profit-taking activities will likely persist due to medium-term expectations on the direction of yields in the FI market. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.”
