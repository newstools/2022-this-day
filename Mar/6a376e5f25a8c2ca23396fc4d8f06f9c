 Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, said at the weekend that the country was gradually returning to peace time after many years of contending with security challenges. He said several parts of the county troubled by various security challenges were embracing peace. He spoke in Abuja while declaring open the ‘2022 edition of the CISM Day Run,’ organised by the Defence Headquarters (DHQ), in collaboration with the International Military Sports Council (CISM). He said the theme of the event: “Running for World Peace,” was apt, especially at a time some nations were  in conflict with each other, in addition to the prevailing insecurity in the country. “If there is anytime the world requires peace, it is now”, he said. Irabor, who stressed that physical fitness is essential as it helps troops to be mentally alert and agile, urged participants to make physical exercise one of their daily habits in order  to be in good shape as they tackle security threats. He lauded the organisers of the event, while also thanking Nigerians for  supporting the armed forces, and other security agencies in their bid to address the challenge of insecurity. The ‘Day Run’ was organised for officers and men of the military establishment and their counterparts from other security agencies. The 5-Km walk/jog exercise is in commemoration of the 2022 anniversary of CISM, globally. The CISM Day Run is aimed at strengthening existing bond and espirit-de-corps between the military and security agencies.
