Analysts Commend Impressive Corporate Earnings Speaking with THISDAY, the Managing Director/CEO APT Securities and Funds Limited, Mr Garba Kurfi commended listed companies for posting impressive results and accounts for 2021, expressing concerns that the declared dividend by these companies did not reflect in the trajectory of the stock market. According to him: “These companies have declared impressive dividend payout to investors but I do not know why the stock market did not respond to dividend payout by Dangote Cement, Zenith Bank, among others. Although the likes of GTCO and UBA released their audited accounts after the close of trading last week, I am yet to see stock price appreciation. “Take, for instance, Lafarge Africa last year was trading at N31 and declared N1.00 per ordinary but this year, the company declared N2.00 and trading at N24.00 per share. The dividend by these companies has not reflected in our domestic market.” The CEO, Wyoming Capital & Partners, Mr Tajudeen Olayinka, urged investors to investigate if these companies were paying from the reserve or current earnings reported on the NGX. “For those companies that have proposed dividend, we praise their effort. If a company is paying from current earnings, it shows effective management despite the challenges. What some of these companies are paying as dividend is substantial which is good for their stock prices.” He added that: “It is excessive if a company is paying over 10per cent yield on its dividend to shareholders and it means these companies are operating at a higher cost per capita.” “When you have a functional market where companies are doing well, I don’t expect a company to pay more than five per cent yield on the dividend to shareholders. “That was the level our domestic market was in 2007 before the global economic meltdown. If a company can pay at least five per cent yield, it means they will be able to raise money at a low level per capital.”
