The female folk who are arguably the largest population in Nigeria, still suffer limited access to environmental goods and control negligible services. Their participation in decision-making processes are not involved in the distribution of environment management benefits. Consequently, women are less able to confront climate change.As Nigeria joins the globe in commemorating the 2022 International Women’s Day, the theme, “Gender equality today, for sustainable tomorrow” explores the emerging concerns of the adverse effects and lingering consequences of climate change within Nigeria’s environment. This also goes to determine the economic and social progress, as well as several openings and potentials which are made available to women and girls to leverage on, and become key participants in decision making  towards creating positive impacts in cushioning the negative implications of climate change.In Nigeria, the poorly constructed politics of gender in the face of climate change are still relatively poorly understood, and women are largely absent in policy making processes. An example was the recent show of shame in which male legislators voted against more seats for women in the federal and state Houses of Assembly.Moreso, the high dependence of rain- dependence agriculture and the over representation of women in this sphere, relatively to men, means that women’s livelihoods and economic empowerment opportunities are being threatened as a result of climate change.For the girl child, climate vulnerables perpetuate pre-existing gender inequalities and exacerbates harmful socially constructed norms and practices. Girls in vulnerable households are more likely to drop out of school during a weather crisis and more susceptible to gender based violence when they are displaced, or schools are closed due to climate related events. “Globally, the UN is working with sister agencies including UNEP and UNDP to demonstrate how gender, climate and security are inextricably linked.“UN women continues to advocate for women’s representation around decision making tables to find sustainable solutions to the climate crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic provided undisputable demonstration of the necessity of women’s leadership in effectively handling a global crisis. “Additionally, UN women is advocating for policy interventions that are targeted at ensuring that women are represented in sectors likely to create higher- end green jobs, energy and construction, with the additional benefit of challenging existing perception on acceptable jobs for women.“The intergovernmental knowledge, skills and leadership of women and girls climate defenders and activists need to be fully brought to bear if societies are to succeed in the conservation and sustainable use of our planet’s limited resources”.It is expected that in harnessing the efforts of donor agencies and international organisations towards supporting women in their expected rightful place, Nigerian government and local stakeholders will explore the field of adequate funding, laudable policy formulation and implementation, as well as inclusivity of women in decision making. Only in the aforementioned and more can Nigeria improve her GDP and better living. Quote
