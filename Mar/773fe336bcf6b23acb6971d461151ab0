Council approved that memorandum.” He added that the second memorandum was presented by the ministry on behalf of one of its parastatals, the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA), which has statutory responsibility for maintenance and rehabilitation of certain roads. He said based on FERMA’s request, FEC approved contracts to rehabilitate Kwara-Peta-Milda road in Borno state in favor of Messrs. CBC Global Civil Engineering and Building Construction.

On his part, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, disclosed that FEC authorised the procurement of lie detector and digital night vision goggles for the NDLEA to enhance their performance. Justifying the rationale for the approval, Malami said: “Two memos were presented this afternoon by the Federal Ministry of Justice on behalf and at the instance of national drugs, law enforcement agency. “As you rightly know, national drugs law enforcement agency is an agency of the government saddled with the responsibility of exterminating illicit drugs trafficking, sales and consumption. “Arising from the fact that they have been doing wonderfully well, in terms of dealing with the scourge associated with drugs, the federal government has considered the possibility of making added provisions and employing and deploying technological equipment skills and competencies that will assist them in delivery. “So, this morning, two memos were taken. One, it was a memo seeking the approval of the council for the award of contract for the supply of eye-scanning lie detector. “Our technology has improved to the extent that we have in place technological equipment that have the capacity to detect whether you are indeed speaking the truth or indeed you are lying in the course of investigation. “So, for the purpose of enhancing the capacity of the NDLEA in exterminating illicit drugs trafficking, sales and consumption, the federal government has considered the need and possibility of indeed providing this equipment to NDLEA. “So, the memo in that respect was presented, it was taken and the contract was approved for MESSR Zettabytes Technologies Limited to procure for the agency these lie detector equipment. So eventually, on that account, the Federal Council approved the award of contract for the supply of eye-scanning lie detector by the National Drugs Law Drugs law enforcement agency in favour of my MESSR Zettabytes Technologies Limited in the sum of N498,850,000 only, inclusive of 7.5 per cent VAT with a completion period of 90 days. That was the first memo that was taken. “And the second memo is a memo by which the NDLEA through the Office of the Attorney General seeks approval of the council with the award for the supply of digital night vision goggle to the NDLEA, this is equally additional technological device that is intended to support the night operations of NDLEA in view of its capacity to support visibility for the NDLEA. “So, the contract too was presented for consideration of the council and the council had graciously approved the award of the contract with the supply of digital night vision goggles by the national drug law enforcement agency in favor of MESSRS R-SET Integrated solution limited in the sum of N570,825,000 only, inclusive of 7.5 per cent VAT with completion period of weeks.
