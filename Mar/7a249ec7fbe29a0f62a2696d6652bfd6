*Says security situation in region being reviewedDeji Elumoye in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has flayed the attack on public property as well as the country home of the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof. George Obiozor, in Imo state. The president, in a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, yesterday, described as, “deeply distressing” the destruction in Imo State, of buildings and assets of the Police and the home of Obiozor, a leading voice of moderation in the affairs of the country. The president, who strongly condemned the violence in the region, urged everyone to maintain peace, adding that the law and order situation in the entire south-east was being reviewed. While this is being done, Buhari called on the people of Imo State in particular and the region in general, to maintain peace as the police and other agencies are working to ensure that normalcy is restored at the earliest. He extended sympathies to the police authorities over the losses of men and materials, and to Obiozor who he urged to maintain his commitment to the peace and oneness of the Federation against the odds.
