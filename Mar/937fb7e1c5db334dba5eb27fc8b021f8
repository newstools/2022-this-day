 Francis Sardauna The Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has warned his political appointees who have ambitions to contest for the 2023 elections against violating the Electoral Act signed by President Muhammudu Buhari as the race for who will succeed him gathers momentum in the state. Masari gave the warning shortly after a closed-door meeting with political appointees, including his Deputy, Alhaji Mannir Yakubu, at the Government House on Tuesday. Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act recently signed into law by President Buhari prevents political office holders in the country from contesting for election from the party primary level without resigning. Consequently, Masari admonished the political appointees who have ambitions to vie for political positions in the state and at the national levels to strictly comply with the Electoral Act. He said: “I call them (political appointees) to brief them on the development of our party, APC, and our preparations for local government elections. Nobody has been sacked and nobody will be sacked. “We briefed those of them who have ambitions to contest elections in 2023 should have a look at the Electoral Act signed by Mr. President so that they will do the needful and avoid the avoidable.” Asked what he meant by the needful, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives said: “They should comply with the Electoral Act.”
