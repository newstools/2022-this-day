 Designer and celebrity stylist, Sharon Ojong is set to launch her first fashion film ‘Children Of God’ for her Rainy Resort 2022 collection. The short film tells the story of a distressed afro-modern man running away from his past and features pieces from the collection worn by a number of style stars. ‘Children of God’ is directed by AMVCA-nominated filmmaker, Uche Odoh and features a versatile cast that includes new face and talented artist Charles Okah, fashion model Bertha Amuga, Shalewa Ashafa, Kemi Smallz, Munachi Abii and Ijeoma Aniebo. Shot in the heart of Lagos, the 12-minute flick spotlights a diverse group of church members unified in their quest for a common good. The 19-member cast, ‘Children of God’ essentially highlights the beauty in our diversity and showcases 19 collection pieces. According to Ojong who is the Creative Director of Rekana and doubles as Executive Producer and Costume Designer on the project, ‘Children of God’ is inspired by “love, passion and inclusion. We wanted to create a collection inspired by real people with real stories, clothing made with eco-friendly, hand-woven and hand-dyed fabrics made with low impact materials for our tie-dye process. And I’m proud we were able to achieve that, both with the collection and the film.” Founded in March 2018, Rekana has continued to make a case for sustainability with each new collection. The label’s design has been seen on some of Africa’s biggest celebrities including BBNaija star Nengi, talented musician Simi, superstar actress Idia Aisien, and the ever stunning Chioma Akpotha.
