 Yinka Olatunbosun The nine-day solo art exhibition, ‘Human Identity Space’ by Kent Onah is now open to art connoisseurs at Terra Kulture, Victoria Island Lagos. The show will run till March 28 as the artist showcases 27 paintings in pursuit of a better world. Onah, who is also a lecturer at the Auchi Polytechnic, has a very firm belief that art beyond aesthetics is a powerful tool for strong conversations that are beyond words. The current exhibition interrogates the human identity space within the context of human challenges. “In this human narrative, I try to showcase the human identity space. The complexity of the human person is such that each person is a complete universe of its own with different attendants. However, the human body is over emphasized against the other dimensions of the complete human being. “The show is also to define our human identity space in order for ‘our consciousness must go beyond our physical conscious experiences. Secondly, we must not rely on what others may put together as the psychology of the human person,” he revealed in a statement. His current paintings invite the viewers to a serious reflection on what constitutes true personality in a distorted and ideological world. “As a multidisciplinary artist and art medicine researcher, I conceptualise and document these experiences on canvas so we can view our life experiences in visual form. Each subtitle constitutes a set of serial paintings telling the human identity story,” he said.
