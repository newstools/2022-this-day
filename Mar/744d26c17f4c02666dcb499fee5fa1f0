For Nigerian and Ghanaian investors, this represents 5.5 times and 8.3 times, respectively, the most recent value of the Ecobank shares they hold. According to the Company Secretary, Madibinet Cisse, “We are pleased to inform our shareholders and the public that the Board of ETI, at its meeting of February 25, 2022, approved the Ecobank consolidated audited accounts for the year ended December 31, 2021 subject to relevant regulatory approvals.
