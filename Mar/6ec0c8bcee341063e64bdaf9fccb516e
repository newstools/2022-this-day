For some time now, he has been involved in political activities in the country as well as deeply involved in philanthropic gestures. Curiously, Ladi Adebutu, in the eyes of his political adversaries, comes across as someone who is living off his rich parentage. However, what his critics would probably not tell you is that he is not just from a wealthy background, but he has also carved a niche for himself in business. It is a fact that he owns several business concerns, one of which is the largest and biggest pig industry in  Nigeria and, by extension, West Africa. Though the former member of the House of Representatives suffered a distasteful experience in the 2019 governorship election in Ogun State, the milk of kindness in him has refused to run dry. Society Watch gathered that the billionaire businessman, rather than being deterred by vitriolic attacks on his person, has shown an uncommon spirit of sportsmanship by not turning his back against his people. Perhaps, this explains why so many celebrated him for his wonted fellow-feeling, good-naturedness and altruistic disposition, last week, when he turned 60, amidst pomp and circumstance. The party, which was held in Abeokuta, Ogun State, was witnessed by top political figures, businessmen as well as several popular socialites. But the birthday celebration was beyond merriment. A source revealed that before the grand finale of the birthday ceremony, the son of billionaire lotto merchant, Sir Kessington Adebutu, showcased his magnanimity by donating several items to all the three senatorial districts of the state. It was also disclosed that the former governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun plans to hold a birthday thanksgiving today at the Celestial Church of Christ, Sagamu.
