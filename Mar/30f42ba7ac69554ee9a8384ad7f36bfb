Basil Sarki, said: “Nobody has made contact with us but we are trusting God that he is alive.”Sarki said he had personally retrieved the vehicle of the abducted clergyman from the spot where he was kidnapped.“I tried getting a mechanic to go with me but nobody wanted so, I went with a rope, tied the car to my own and drove it to safety.“Little offering collected at the mass conducted by the abducted clergyman and some of his books were intact in the car.“They shot at the tyres of the car, I pray the bullet did not hit him,” he said.
