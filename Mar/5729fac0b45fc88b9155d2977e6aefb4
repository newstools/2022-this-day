 James Emejo Non-profit advocacy and empowerment group, Hacey Health Initiative has donated food products to the Zion Orphanage and Widows Home in Lugbe, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The development organisation is focused on improving the health and productivity of vulnerable and underserved populations in Africa. The donation was carried out in partnership with Access Bank and the Dangote Group. State Coordinator for Hacey Health Abuja, Ololade Ogunnubi said the organisation was established to provide sustainable solutions to close the inequality gap that limits women and girls’ access to health and economic empowerment. She said the focus is on women, girls and education. She said, “We do IT techs for women, tech for girls, we do online video shows where they get talks about social things that happen in a community.” Ogunnubi said the “whole idea is to show love to orphans and widows to make them understand that they’re not left alone and that there is someone out there that thinks about them”. She said the intervention would extend to more vulnerable centers across the country. The donations included 300 packs of food products each consisting of four packs of spaghetti, classics seasoning, salt, sugar, stew mix among others. Founded in 2007, Hacey is committed to supporting women, girls and young people in Nigeria to live a productive and healthy life. This is achieved through its Innovation, Capacity development, Advocacy, Research and Education (i.C.A.R.E) approach.
