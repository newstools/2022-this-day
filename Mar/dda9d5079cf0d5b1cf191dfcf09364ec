 Olusegun Samuel Despite mild protest from some political stakeholders from Ekeremor and Sagbama Federal Constituency in Bayelsa State over an alleged zoning agreements, supporters of the incumbent Senator representing the area, Seriake Dickson, has thrown their weight behind his reelection bid. In a meeting with the Ekeremor local government Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leaders and stakeholders led by the Deputy Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon. Michael Ogbere, and the chairman of the local government area, Hon. Bertola Perekeme, and hundreds of stakeholders and supporters, they announced their resolution to buy the senatorial Expression of Interest and nomination forms for Senator Dickson. The Ekeremor PDP stakeholders backed their resolution by raising the sum of N10 million on the spot from voluntary donations by the stakeholders present. The stakeholders said the donations were made in appreciation of the numerous good deeds and developmental projects Dickson brought to the people and land of Ekeremor during his time as governor. They also appreciated the fact that against all odds, Dickson backed, supported and handed over to their son, Governor Douye Diri, who is maternally from Ekeremor LGA. The stakeholders declared that they were in total support of Dickson, as they are not ungrateful. They asked the public to dismiss mischief makers who are bent on dividing the party with propaganda on purported zoning which has never been implemented nor respected in the senatorial district at any time in their history. They declared that Senator Dickson has no other contenders in  the PDP or in any other political party as far as Bayelsa West senatorial district is concerned.
