Emma OkonjiThe Lagos State University (LASU), has upgraded the university’s certificate for graduatingstudents with instant verification feature.With the upgrade, the certificate for graduates of the 25th convocation and beyond will nowcarry a very unique addition, by way of an instant verification feature. The need to upgrade the certificate, based on the intervention by the university’s Departmentof Information and Communications Technology (DICT), is to further improve the security ofthe university’s certificate and to ease the verification process. The Acting Director, DICT at LASU, Dr. Toyin Enikuomehin, who disclosed the initiative in astatement, said with the new feature of the certificate, verification request for certificateswould henceforth need not be sent to LASU, as the technology embedded in the certificateand it’s photocopies will permit the verification of the document without any compromise inthe verification process life cycle. He further explained that since security item is ubiquitous, documents could be verified usinga smart phone so that decisions on those wishing to study abroad, and for those seekingpromotion at workplaces, could be reached at real time.“This initiative is in furtherance of the digitalization project of the University ofLagos,” Enikuomehin said. The DR Exams and Record also adds that the old certificates earlier issued without the newlydeployed feature will still have to go through the existing process for conventional certificateverification as advertised on the LASU website whenever the need for verification arisesOn completion of the verification process; if genuine; relevant information on the graduate willbe generated for the verifier to print or save.
