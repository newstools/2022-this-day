Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Katsina State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has challenged the state government to publish the names and operators of the 232 accounts allegedly inherited from the party’s administration in 2015 in national dailies for clarity. The main opposition party also challenged the state government to explain to the citizens of the state the kind of transactions that took place in the 232 bank accounts within the period under review. Addressing journalists Saturday in Katsina, the state PDP Chairman, Hon. Salisu Yusuf Majigiri, said the then PDP administration of Ibrahim Shehu Shema didn’t operate 232 accounts. THISDAY earlier reported that the state Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Faruk Lawal Jobe, said the government of Aminu Bello Masari has closed 232 accounts inherited from PDP and recovered N4 billion in 2015. But Majigiri, while reacting to the allegation, said: “What the commissioner said is not true. We have not left 232 accounts in several banks in Katsina to the best of our knowledge. They didn’t inherit 232 accounts from us. “He must publish the names of the 232 bank accounts and operators of the accounts in national dailies because there is no account being operated without a signatory. “And he said in the accounts, they mopped up N4 billion, so that means if they mopped up N4 billion from the 232 accounts that we have not submitted officially and we have left N14.5 billion in the government coffers in 2015.” According to him, “So, this has shown that we have left alltogether N18.5 billion including the N4 billion he is saying that they recovered from the 232 accounts but there is no single N3 billion project to show in the state.”
