The crisis, which started late Monday evening at the rail line axis of the  popular Lafenwa market of Abeokuta metropolis, spanned the night till yesterday  morning when some of the urchins allegedly set some market stalls ablaze. It was gathered that the street urchins had approached the driver of a truck at the Lafenwa market, where they demanded  a certain financial inducement for them to clear traffic and enable the truck maneuver the traffic build up at the market. One of the traders, who witnessed the situation around 8: 30p.m Monday evening, explained that the money offered by the truck driver was picked by one of the scavengers, who allegedly ran to hide it under one of the stalls in the market. She further explained that the other urchins chased him to the stall, where he was beaten and was eventually rushed to the hospital for treatment.
