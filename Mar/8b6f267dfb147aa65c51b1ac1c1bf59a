 Francis Sardauna in Katsina The National President of Maize Farmers Association of Nigeria (MFAN), Bello Abubakar Funtua, has said that no fewer than 500,000 maize farmers across Nigeria have benefitted from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Anchor Borrowers programme in the last six years. Funtua disclosed this when he led members of the association on a courtesy call to the Emir of Katsina, Dr. Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, Tuesday. He explained that 80,000 maize farmers in Katsina State have benefited from the CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme as part of an effort to enhance food production in the state. According to him, “We have more than 80,000 maize farmers in Katsina State that benefitted from the CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme through the Maize Farmers association of Nigeria. “We have also assisted at least 500,000 maize farmers across the country under the CBN’s  Anchor Borrowers programme in the last six years. And the production of maize has increased. “From 2015 to date, we had an increment of 12 million tonnes because in 2015 maize production was eight million tonnes but with the coming of the present administration and the introduction of the Anchor Borrowers programme, maize production has risen to 20 tonnes in 2021.” He reiterated that the CBN’s Anchor Borrowers programme has gone a long way in ensuring the federal government’s policy of diversifying the economy and ensuring that agriculture is at the forefront. Responding, the emir said banditry and insurgency have negatively affected farming activities in the North-west and  North-east regions of the country, adding that many farmers have been killed by the hoodlums. He admonished members of the association not to allow politicians and other people with questionable characters to take over the ownership of their activities and ensure that real farmers benefitted from their programmes.
