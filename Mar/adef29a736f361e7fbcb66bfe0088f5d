Notes for File  Former Director-General of the Progressive Governors’ Forum, Dr. Salihu Lukman, recently introduced two new terminologies into the nation’s political lexicon and those terms immediately caught the fancy of many political observers with the speed of light. Lukman, who was forced to resign in the thick of the All Progressives Congress (APC) leadership crisis, first came up with the term, “yahoo-yahoo governors”, when trying to identify some of the governors believed to be undermining the APC leadership and as well responsible for the crisis of trust currently eating up the party. The former DG of the PDF reportedly used the term “yahoo-yahoo”, because the lot of those he identified in that category were people he alleged had no “character and integrity”, and as such, had no business being anywhere close to power. He went on to mention a few of the names, just so it was clear those he had in mind. Soon after the APC crisis escalated with the change in the CECPC leadership, Lukman, authored yet another article, where he pleaded with stakeholders in the party not to allow those he described as “Bureau De Change managers” to take over the leadership. In this particular instance, Lukman referred to those he insinuated had been moving money around to buy the party leadership and by implication, pocket it at the detriment of others. He, therefore, alluded to some of the implications of letting that nightmare become a reality in the APC. Unfortunately, that all these are happening in a party, whose government is led by a man, who wears integrity as a badge of honour, makes it all the more disturbing – beyond its newsworthiness. And, with the hyped battle against corruption and other related vices, nothing typifies more, the national ailments that the APC itches to cure than the APC itself.
