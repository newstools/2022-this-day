Deji Elumoye in Abuja Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has emphasised that government agencies must at all times respect the citizenry as well as being accountable to them.According to him, beyond core regulatory roles, government parastatals must always show that they are responsible to the people that they serve and that they hold them in high esteem.Osinbajo, who stated this Monday while playing host to a delegation of the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) in town for the council’s 70th Annual Meeting stressed that: “It is very important that we show respect for our citizens and show that we are concerned about them, that we are not just a regulatory body that feels that its role is just to be a policeman, and all of that. “I think we must also show that we are responsible for the people that we serve and that we hold them in high esteem.”The vice-president cited as an example the prompt response of WAEC to the issue of some candidates having difficulties regarding the National Identification Number (NIN), where the body responded that due to the challenges with the NIMC portal at the time, the affected candidates could still sit for the exams.He said: “These kinds of quick responses show respect for citizens,” adding that he is also personally happy that the Examinations Council is responsive and aligning with the digital technology age in different areas.His words: “Just looking at the press reports and what WAEC has done, it has shown that it is very responsive to the needs of society. I was particularly impressed by the new digital certification that was announced some time ago, that if one lost his/her WAEC certificate, you can apply for the digital copy, which means your records are never lost.“There is no need for the long and hard process of seeking for a certified (physical) copy. I think this is true response to the times. That is very good.”Osinbajo also congratulated WAEC for its achievement since it was established about 70 years ago.While highlighting the important role of the council in the nation’s educational development, he said many Nigerians have benefitted from the WAEC certification over the years.In underscoring the significance of WAEC’s certificate, the vice-president said: “It (WAEC certification) is almost like a birth certificate. “Everyone who has watched WAEC progress over the years would agree that WAEC is a huge part of our history as a nation. WAEC certification has that importance and it has been like that for 70 years. So, I think it is worthy of celebration and commendation, WAEC has done so very well through the years.“So, I congratulate you, the Nigerian team, and the WAEC Council, not just for being given the special privilege of hosting the 70th anniversary, but also because we are clearly the largest contributor and beneficiary and this has been so for 70 years.”Earlier in her remarks, the leader of the Nigerian members of WAEC, who is also the Director, Basic & Secondary Education, Federal Ministry of Education, Hajia Binta Abdulkadir, thanked the federal government “for the opportunity to host the 70th Annual Council Meeting, as well as the support to the council over the years”.According to her, the council is the highest decision-making body of WAEC with membership drawn from the five-member countries namely Nigeria, The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ghana.She also disclosed that the Annual Council Meeting will be used to deliberate on providing qualitative and educational assessment, encouraging academic and moral excellence, promoting human resource development and promoting international cooperation among the member countries.
