Business Metrics Nigeria, which is driving the discussion, has put together the second edition of its Policy Implementation Assisted Forum (PAIFo) to drive the 5G Policy to fruition. According to the organisers, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, including the Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta and the Central Bank Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, would lead industry stakeholders to discuss 5G implementation and rollout plan in Nigeria. NCC, in a letter, confirmed that Danbatta would be delivering a keynote address at the forum, while restating the support of the Commission for the project. Speaking about the forum, the Lead Executive, PIAFo and Managing Editor, Business Metrics Nigeria, Omobayo Azeez, said: “The socio-economic benefits of 5G is enormous and every serious country will not only be interested in deploying the network but to also try to get it right. Since Nigeria is now leading other West African countries in the 5G race, we cannot afford any try and error.”
