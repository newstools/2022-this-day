 Nigeria Women’s cricket team made it two wins out of two, this time beating Germany in a historic first-ever meeting between the two sides. The win comes after the team had earlier defeated Brazil yesterday at the 7th Kwibuka T20 Women Tournament in Rwanda. Nigeria won the toss and put the European side to bat. A move that speaks both to their belief in their bowling attack and their ability to chase down a score. A development the President of the Nigeria Cricket Federation says had justified the federation’s investment in the team. “I am particularly very happy at their performance. They had a little hitches here and there but you must admit that this team has improved from what we saw earlier in March in Lagos and they are getting better with every game.” Teenage sensations Lilian Ude and Rukayat Abdulrasaq took the new ball for Nigeria and bowled beautifully but it was Rachael Samson with four wickets for 13 runs from her four overs who did real damage. Christina Gough 22(49) and Sharanya Sadarangani 22(30) were the only ones to put up any real resistance. In their reply, the Nigerians were expected to make light work of the total but their innings got off to a shaky start, losing Kehinde Abdulquadri and Agatha Obulor cheaply before the pair of Esther Sandy and Salome Sunday 32(40) took the game away from Germany. This win moves Nigeria to the top of the standings at the ongoing KwibukaT20 Tournament in Kigali along with Kenya, as the only teams with 100 percent record so far. Rwanda nicked their first win at the event after over Brazil with a 35-run victory after losing to Kenya in their Opening game by six wickets. On match day three, today, Nigeria faces Botswana, and hopes to a third win to remain top of the table and a better chance at the Kwibuka honours.
