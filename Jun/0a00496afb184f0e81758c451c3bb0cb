 A vibrant political women group under the aegis of ‘Grassroots Progressive Women’, has continued to drum support for the candidacy of a former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the best man for the Presidency ahead the ongoing primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja. Addressing female delegates from the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Monday, the group’s National Mobiliser, Hon Stella Okotete charged the delegates to go out in their hundreds and vote for the gender-friemdly Bola Ahmed Tinubu at the Eagles Square. Okotete, who was the immediate past National Women Leader of the party and the National mobilizer, Grassroot Progressive Women Forum, a national platform with over five million members, strong grassroots structure and network across the country, stated that the future of women and the country can be guaranteed only in the hands of Bola Ahmed Tinubu. She urged the delegates to focus only on the candidacy of Bola Tinubu as he is the only aspirant that can deliver the votes for the party in the next general election. In their response, the large gathering of women unanimously threw their weight and support behind her, saying they know they can trust her judgement as she led them to national and international visibility during her short reign as the women representative of the Caretaker Committee. They assured her of their unalloyed loyalty and expressed their confidence in her leadership and guidance.
