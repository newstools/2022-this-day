President Muhammadu Buhari has taken a swipe at the regime of military President Ibrahim Babangida for annulling the June 12 Presidential Election won by Late Chief MKO Abiola.The annulled election has been adjudged the freest and fairest in the nation’s history.In his address to the nation to mark this year’s Democracy Day,  President Buhari said, “On June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.”Buhari recalled that in 2018, his government moved Democracy Day from May 29 to June 12, adding, “this change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.”He said, “We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria’s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.”
