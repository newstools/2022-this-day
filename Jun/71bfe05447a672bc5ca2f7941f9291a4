 Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia As political parties position their candidates for various elective seats in readiness for the 2023 general election, a group under the aegis of the Arochukwu Consultative Forum (ACF) has advocated the adoption of a consensus candidate for Arochukwu State Constituency. To this end, the ACF has thrown its weight in support of adopting the flag bearer of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Prince Ike Okorafor as the sole candidate for the Arochukwu state constituency come 2023. The ACF, which is composed of eminent men and women of all political and allied groups in Arochukwu local government, took the resolution of adopting Prince Okoroafor at its extraordinary special meeting for aggregation and consolidation. In a release signed by the ACF Chairman, Dr. Uche Okoro, the group said that its preference and total support for Prince Okorafor was based on his records of achievements and impacts on his people, both home and abroad; “At the end of our aggregation and consolidation meeting with participants drawn across the entire Arochukwu State Constituency, we x-rayed the rich resume and accomplishments of Prince Ike Okorafor and therefore, adopted him as our preferred choice for Arochukwu State Constituency in 2023,” the group said. In further explaining its position, the ACF said that it was impressed by Prince Okoroafor’s “academic prowess, ingenuity, poise and determination to excel even when others faltered” adding that “his exposure, experience and doggedness distinguished him from his contemporaries.” The group stated that the APGA candidate for Arochukwu State Constituency would offer the people of Arochukwu “a robust, efficient and effective representation” given his eloquence and knowledge. The ACF, therefore, urged “the good people of Arochukwu State Constituency to rally round and ensure that Prince Ike Okorafor emerged victorious at the general poll come 2023.”
