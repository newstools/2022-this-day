 Great things are happening in our country, Nigeria. In the past four weeks, the corporate industry appears to have been given a boost. Innovations are on the horizon, it seems, and some of these innovations, like Lanre Ore’s FiberOne, will serve as frameworks and foundations for the others. Considering Ore’s recent rebranding of the fibre broadband company, one can only expect the best from the rebranded firm. Even though its services are far above average, it has been a while since FiberOne was in the news. Nevertheless, the company has burst upon the media scene with its latest actions. The company had announced that starting June 1, 2022, FiberOne Broadband would take on ‘a new way of life’ with a new logo and a renewed intention to make life and living easier for Nigerians. Ore’s rebranding initiative doubtlessly comes from a recognition of the role that internet connection plays in the lives of Nigerians. Established in 2017, its focus is on providing the best and most affordable internet connection to Nigerians since its launch in 2017. Now, as Ore explained, the goal of the company is no longer to provide internet connections but to enable them. Expectations from Nigerians are at an all-time high, to say the least. After all, Ore and his company have never failed Nigerians before. This is why they have been able to establish a strong business presence all over Nigeria, including in Lagos, Abuja, Rivers, and Kwara. With this rebranding, it is expected that FiberOne will be able to reach areas in Nigeria heretofore untouched and untouchable by the internet.
