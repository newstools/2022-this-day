 The President of the Nigeria Cricket Federation, Uyi Akpata, has arrived in the Rwandan capital city  Kigali to drum up support for the Nigeria’s women’s national team. Akpata watched their last round-robin match in which they lost to the host teamyesterday morning. He said, “Every time the team shows up at Kwibuka, we see this as part of our developmental journey. We lost today and I am sure the technical team have their notes full. “Another interesting dimension is that we have a couple of players here that will form the core of Nigeria’s under-19 team and this experience will surely be an asset to them,” he added. The Nigeria’s women’s team at the Kwibuka T20 started the tournament with three back-to-back-back wins over; Brazil, Germany and Botswana before crumbling in their last four outings against Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. Nigeria had won the toss and elected to field against the host on Thursday, one that held the Rwandan Women to a 91 for the loss of seven wickets at the end of the first inning. The Nigeria Women struggled to a 68 total with four wickets in hand to lose in the second inning. Nigeria will be facing Brazil for the team’s last match, a placement to determine the fifth and sixth place  at the event. Leke Oyede, Nigeria’s Coach stressed that there definitely are rooms for improvement and it can only come when the players are subjected to tough games like the ones the Kwibuka offered. “We are hoping to give a decent ending to this series with a good show in our last match.” Nigeria is also presenting a team in an elite match between a Nigerian selected over 50 that would engaging the Rwandan selected side. The match is an exhibition match meant to strengthen tie between the countries.
