 Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) has appealed to the Chief Judge of Ekiti State, Justice John Adeyeye, to establish a special court to handle gender related cases. FIDA made the request yesterday while paying courtesy visit to the state Chief Judge in his office in Ado Ekiti. Addressing the Chief Judge, Ekiti State FIDA Chairperson, Mrs. Oyinade Olatunbosun, said: “We humbly request for the establishment of a special court to attend to gender-based issues. “This request is as stipulated by Section 370 of the Gender-based Violence Prohibition Law of Ekiti State as amended.” She congratulated the Chief Judge for his giant strides aimed at shooting the state judiciary to limelight, especially the remote court hearing recently put to test, saying that further affirmed the readiness of the Jurist to fortify the temple of justice. The FIDA boss added: “This type of visit became necessary to introduce the current executives of the organisation who assumed office in December 2021 to the Chief Judge and to discuss with him some of the challenges facing FIDA. “We have the challenges of funds in paying filing fees in courts, as all cases ranging from matrimonial issues, child abuse, rape, defilement, gender-based violence among others were being handled pro bono in all courts up to the Appeal Court level.” In his response, Justice Adeyeye promised to work with FIDA and render the judiciary assistance within its power to them anytime the need arises. Justice Adeyeye said: “Judiciary does not make laws, but interprets them. I promise to discuss with concerned authorities your requests, make needed amendment and proffer solutions where necessary.”
