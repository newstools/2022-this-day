 Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Sylvester Idowu in Warri A former minister of Niger Delta Affairs in the Goodluck Jonathan administration, Elder God’sday Orubebe, has announced his resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), saying the party was not ready to return to power in 2023. Orubebe made his resignation from the PDP known yesterday in a letter dated June 20, 2022,personally signed and forwarded to the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, a copy of which was made available to newsmen. The former minister stated that the reason for his resignation was because of the emergence of a northern presidential candidate in the party. The letter read: “I write to formally inform you of my resignation from the PDP. This I have communicated to the Chairman of Burutu Ward 3, Burutu Local Government Area, Delta State, effective 20th June, 2022. “Consequently, I am by this letter intimating you of my total withdrawal from all activities at the Ward, Local, State and National levels of the PDP. “I am highly honoured and privileged to have been part of a political party that successfully transformed a pariah nation to one that commanded respect in the comity of nations,”  he stated. Orubebe, however, expressed satisfaction with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for pursuing his presidential ambition vigorously in the just concluded PDP presidential primary election. He also queried the moves by the northern region to superimpose themselves in leadership against other regions in the country.
