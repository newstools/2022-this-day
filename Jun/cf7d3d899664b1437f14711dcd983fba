 Ferdinand Ekechukwu Busola has forever been unlucky with love. Pressured by society and her parent to tie the knot as a means of lifting her family out of poverty, she finally meets Tunji – the perfect man. At first, Busola struggles to understand why a billionaire would choose to marry her but after she accepts his proposal of marriage, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead her to a truth she could never have imagined. The foregoing is the synopsis of a forthcoming movie, ‘Ile Owo’, which in English means ‘House of Money’. Written and directed by Dare Olaitan, the cast includes Efa Iwara, Bisola Aiyeola, Bukunmi ‘Kie Kie’ Adeaga, Sophie Alakija, Akin Lewis, Temisan Emmanuel, Demola Adedoyin, Mofe Duncan, Tina Mba, Immaculata Oko Kasum, Jblaze Jide Oyegbile, Patrick Diabuah, Taye Arimoro and Ikponmwosa Gold. “It’s about inequality which in a way almost (what) my films are about but this time we approach it with the genre conventions of horror, thriller and romance. See you soon and remember. Love is worth dying for and everything has a price,” wrote Olaitan on Instagram. His post preceded a two-minute trailer filled with exciting horror flashes. But hints on the plot, which according to the filmmaker, will explore inequality with “the genre conventions of horror, thriller and romance.” Ile Owo is Kasum’s Film Trybe’s second co-production with Singularity Media, but the 4th work involving Olaitan, Kayode Kasum’s Film Trybe and FilmOne Entertainment. ‘Ile Owo’ (House of Money) will open in cinemas on June 24. In 2021, Kasum co-directed ‘Dwindle’ with Dare Olaitan (who also had a co-writing credit in the buddy comedy film). This time, Olaitan solely takes the directorial in what promises to be a must see movie. In an earlier statement, Olaitan said, “I think a great movie is a movie that captures some essential truth of life, freezing it to be examined forever, teaching us things that we may not have yet realised about ourselves.”
