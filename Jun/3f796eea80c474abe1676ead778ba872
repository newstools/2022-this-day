 Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja The Presidential Support Committee (PSC) has congratulated the National leader of the support group, Senator Godswill Akpabio for clinching the Senatorial ticket of Akwa Ibom North West under the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, for the 2023 general election. The National Chairman of the support group, Rt. Hon. Gideon Sammani issued the congratulations in a statement signed yesterday by Director Media and Publicity National Working Committee, PSC, Dr. Kailani Muhammad. The group noted that Akpabio, the former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, had earlier contested for the party’s presidential ticket at the APC Presidential Primaries held in Abuja but stepped down for the eventual party’s candidate, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Akpabio contested for the Akwa Ibom North West Senatorial ticket in a rerun following the cancellation of the primary election held earlier on May 28, which was nullified as a result of petitions bordering on security infractions. He secured a total of 478 votes out of the 512 accredited delegates, while his opponents, DIG Ekpo Udom (Rtd.) and Sir Joseph Akpan scored three and one votes, respectively. PSC said the landslide victory had clearly demonstrated how the people of Akwa Ibom held Senator Akpabio in high esteem due to his uncommon transformation of the state while he was the state’s chief executive for eight years. The group prayed for his emergence as winner of the general election coming up in 2023, describing the development as his acceptability by the people of his constituency. It also saluted Akpabio’s resilience and patriotic resolve to step down for Tinubu in the just concluded APC Presidential Primaries, describing his action as uncommon, noting he took the decision in the best national interest.
