 Mauricio Pochettino has reportedly been sacked as manager of Paris Saint-Germain after the Argentine and the club reached an agreement on his exit. Pochettino has been in charge for 18 months and led the club to the Ligue 1 title in his first full season, finishing 15 points clear of second placed Marseille – the biggest margin of victory in any of Europe’s big five divisions. But the club’s Champions League exit to Real Madrid at the last-16 was a factor in the mutual decision for Pochettino to leave Paris. Nice Head Coach, Christophe Galtier, is thought to be the front-runner to replace Pochettino after Luis Campos replaced Leonardo as sporting director. According to ESPN, talks with Galtier have progressed well and he is keen to take up the daunting role at the French champions. Former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane had been believed to be the preferred choice of Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar who owns PSG.
