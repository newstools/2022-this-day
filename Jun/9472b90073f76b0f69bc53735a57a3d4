THISDAY gathered that the official was arrested over the alleged offence at the INEC office in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state. Public Affairs officer of INEC in the state, Geraldine Ekelemu confirmed the arrest. Ekelemu, who spoke on behalf of the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Obong Efanga, said, “INEC in Rivers State can confirm that one of its security guards attached to its Obio/Akpor area office, has been arrested by agents of the Department of State Security on allegation of extortion of money from members of the public. “INEC has a zero tolerance to acts of extortion by its staff and would ensure that the security agencies investigate this and any other allegations of illegality by its officials to ensure that every infraction is redressed and punished.” Ekelemu, therefore, advised members of the public to avoid acts of desperation that could render them vulnerable to fraudsters taking advantage of them. “They are also encouraged to report attempts at extortion to INEC or the security agencies,” she added, noting that all INEC offices in Rivers were open and attending to potential registrants while registration was also ongoing in designated locations in some wards on a rotational basis.
