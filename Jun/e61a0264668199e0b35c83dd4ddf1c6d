Society Watch Wealth, it is said, is nothing, if it cannot be used for the advancement of society and mankind. This age-long wise saying is not strange to Olori Janet Afolabi, wife of the Alapomu of Apomu Kingdom, as she has been deploying her wealth to the service of humanity, especially in her domain. All her actions in the past years point to the fact that she shares in her husband’s vision, which is to further change the face of the kingdom, while also bettering the lives of the indigenes. In line with her wonted fellow-feeling and abiding commitment to giving back to the society that has given her fame, she recently played host to more than 900 school children around the kingdom and distributed 1,000 books to commemorate Children’s Day, on May 27. Beyond the gifts, other activities such as march pass, quiz and dance competitions were organised, with winners going home with prizes. Hon. Maroof Akinremi, Chairman, Isokan Local Government Area of Osun State, presented the first prize trophy to Prophet Muhammed School, which won in marching. Sunday Odewale from St Barnabas Anglican Primary school won the first prize in the dance competition. Among those who attended the event were the Woman Leader of Apomu market  Christian Akinlabu; Otun Iyalode of Apomu and youth corps members, among others.
