 Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano Airlifting of intending pilgrims of Kaduna and Jigawa states for this year’s Hajj has been relocated to Mallam Aminu International Airport Kano (MAKIA). Kaduna and Jigawa states had been allocated the slot of 2,491and 641 Hajj slots respectively. The first batch of intending pilgrims from Kaduna was scheduled to depart Nigeria on Tuesday on Azman air, but it had been shifted due to the decision. Zonal Coordinator, Kano Zone, National Hajj Commission of Nigeria, (NAHCON), Lawal Ahmed Katsina stated this at a stakeholders’ meeting  yesterday in Kano. Lawal said that the emergency decision was taken by the Hajj Commission because the airports of the two affected states had not been certified for this year’s Hajj airlift. The NAHCON zonal coordinator, however, revealed that arrangement has been concluded for hitch free airlift of intending pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, adding that both Kaduna and Jigawa board are being duly briefed on the emergency decision. The coordinator therefore, appealed to all stakeholders to ensure a successful and hitch-free Hajj operation this year. In their respective remarks, all stakeholders had expressed total readiness to stage a successful Hajj operation this year. The stakeholders at the meeting were Nigeria Customs Service, Nigeria Immigration Service, Nigeria Police Force, Department of State Service (DSS) and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence (NSCDC).
