 Dike Onwuamaeze The Nigeria Breweries Plc is set to thrill consumers of Goldberg lager beer with premium enjoyment and empowerment at the Goldberg Takeover Party (GTP), which is slated for Sunday, June 5, 2022, at the Panseke Skating Ground, Post Office Area, Abeokuta, Ogun State. The Nigerian Breweries said that Goldberg, which is brewed by its master brewers, would use the GTP to celebrate “our culture, values and true identity as a platform that recognises the dignity of labour of the ‘ỌMỌLÚÀBÍ,’ a term used to refer to the consumers of the brand, as well as the need for them to be celebrated. “This is borne out of the idea that every OMỌLÚÀBÍ deserves recognition for all they do and their perseverance despite the climes and state of affairs.” The GTP would also serve as a platform to celebrate indigenous traditional music and musical instruments reinvented with modernity, and feature Nigerian Singer and Rapper, Reminisce, also known as “Alaga Ibile,” as well as Agege Bred Afro-pop Recording Artist, Small Doctor. Other artist billed to perform at the event include DJ Kaywise, Karkarkey, the Ayanwale of Goldberg, while Hardvantage will be the “hyman” of the night. In addition, two of Abeokuta’s disc jockeys, DJ Realsexcy and DJ Move would be competing head to head, showcasing their dexterity on the turntables for a share of the N1million cash prize Goldberg will be giving out at the event. Consumers in Abeokuta and its environs would also enjoy an extraordinary lineup of events as Goldberg has planned to make the Abeokuta edition an unforgettable experience.
