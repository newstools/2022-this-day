 Gilbert Ekugbe The UN World Food Programme in partnership with the German, Norway, Niger and Lebanese governments have initiated a Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS) to address the looming global food crisis. In an online press briefing yesterday, the coalition stated the need for a coordinated and strong international response to the looming global food crisis. Indeed, the world is witnessing an unprecedented food crisis caused by the convergence of COVID-19, conflict, rising costs, the climate crisis, and now the ripple effect of the conflict in Ukraine. There is an urgent need to respond not only to immediate humanitarian needs but also to invest in longer term solutions that will prevent the next crisis. The event was attended by the WFP Assistant Executive Director for Partnerships and Advocacy Ute Klamert; Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany, Her Excellency Svenja Schulze; Minister of International Development of Norway; Her Excellency Anne Beathe Tvinnereim; Minister of Humanitarian Action and Disaster Management of Niger, His Excellency Laouan Magagi and Minister of Economy and Trade of Lebanon His Excellency Amin Salam. The GAFS is expected to bring together key donor countries and the most vulnerable and most affected countries, with key stakeholders from the United Nations system, philanthropists and civil society. The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organisation, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.
