 Financial technology organisation, SystemSpecs has stressed the need to adopt modern technologies to be able to achieve competent human resource management (HRM) operations. Managing Director of SystemSpecs Technology, Demola Igbalajobi stated this while addressing students and staff from the Industrial Relations and HRM Unit of Covenant University who were on an academic visit to the organisation. According to Igbalajobi, the impact of tech-driven human resources was evident in the growth of SystemSpecs and its ability to scale challenges. He added that having a committed, intelligent and competent workforce was an advantage to corporate growth. While engaging the visitors on trends in the sector, he shared insights into how human resource management practice works with technology, making reference to how SystemSpecs, being a provider of human capital management technology solutions has fared with modern tools supported by staff commitment. He said, “Our challenges have changed over time as we develop. However, getting intelligent, committed staff and people of good character has helped us in overcoming various challenges over the past 3 decades. “Our recruitment process is rigorous so that we can get the brightest of the brightest. Sound character and ethics are also important to us. At SystemSpecs, we desire people who are not only creative but also have a strong desire to create positive change in the society.” In his remark, Head of Covenant University’s Industrial and HRM Unit, Dr. Odunayo Salau said, “This academic visit has given us some exposure on how HRM practices can best be implemented. Now we are seeing the need to move from conventional way of doing things to a strategic approach. “We can see the inevitability of technology in the practice of HRM, reflected in technology solutions such as the Enterprise Resource Programme (ERP), which I think every organisation should have.”
