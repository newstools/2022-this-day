He added other factors that include, “Relatively low interest rates in the fixed income market. However, this may reverse soon following the recent hike in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria  (CBN). “Effective regulation on the part of the SEC has helped to boost confidence.” He added that, “Perhaps, the strongest driver has been improved corporate performance of many quoted companies.
