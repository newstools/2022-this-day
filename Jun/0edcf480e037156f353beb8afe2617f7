 Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja A former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs and presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Godswill Akpabio, has denied stepping down for the National Leader and presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu, ahead of the party’s primary. Some sections of the media had reported that Akpabio had stepped down for Tinubu. But  in a statement issued on Sunday by the Director, Media And Publicity, Godswill Akpabio Campaign Organisation (GACO), Sylvester Okonkwo, Akpabio said he remained the aspirant to beat. The presidential hopeful insisted that he has no reason to withdraw, nor was he contemplating it, saying it was  the wishful thinking of some mischief makers hired by some politicians to misinform and misdirect his supporters. Akpabio said: “The attention of the Godswill Akpabio Campaign Organisation (GACO) has been drawn to a news item in an online news platform, purporting that our presidential hopeful and the choice of majority of Nigerians in the 2023 presidential race, Senator Godswill Akpabio, has stepped down for a particular aspirant. “Ordinarily, we would have allowed this to slide, because we view it as the wishful thinking of some mischief makers hired by some politicians to misinform and misdirect the resolve of the teeming supporters of our aspirant from casting their votes for him at the party’s Special Convention for presidential primary, hence this response. “We hereby state unequivocally that the Uncommon Transformer, Senator Godswill Akpuabio, is firmly in the race. He has not stepped down for any aspirant neither has he withdrawn from the presidential contest. He has no reason to withdraw neither is he thinking about it. He is in the race, not only to win the party’s sole ticket, but to also emerge the president of this great country in 2023 Insha Allah.” Akpabio therefore assured his supporters that he hasn’t stepped down from the race.
