 *As institute clocks 50 Kuni Tyessi in Abuja The Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators of Nigeria (ICSAN) has called for the probe of key areas that contribute to the growth of the Nigerian economy. It said that the dwindling foreign reserves have continued to led to loss of jobs while the ability to make purchases has become extremely difficult with the average Nigerian being the victim. The President of the ICSAN, Mr. Gbenga Taiwo Owokolade, stated this yesterday during a briefing to commemorate 50 years of the existence of ICSAN, which would be marked on today. He said that the cost of production would remain terrible once the Dollar continues to soar against the Naira. The theme of the anniversary is titled “External reserves Dynamics and governance challenges,” Owokolade lamented that the falling reserves have a huge implication on the economy. He said if small businesses do not contribute considerably to the economy, then the foreign reserves would continue to fall. “External reserves keep coming down and this has huge implication in the economy. It will affect individuals as well. Compare the rate if the naira to the dollar. Many are saying it might rise to a thousand or a thousand and five hundred naira to a dollar. What’s the implication on the average person? “Imagine people depending on generator and diesel for their businesses. This only shows how difficult it will be for the manufacturing sector. Having access to the final products will also be difficult. “If small businesses don’t contribute considerable to the economy, then the foreign reserves will continue to fall. We can make lots of money from small businesses. “Critical issues like that if subsidy is affecting the external reserves. So this theme is at the heart of the survival of the average Nigerian. Government’s efforts are not best enough. This is not about criticising its policies, but critiquing it,” he said.
