 In a related development, Nwachukwu stressed that a Muslim-Muslim running mates for the 2023 presidential election would be unacceptable to Christians. Nwachukwu admonished the two leading political parties that had chosen Muslims as their standard bearers to remember that choosing Muslims as their running mates would amount to neglect of Christians. Delivering his sermon yesterday titled: ‘The battle I will like to lose,’ he said: “I want the political class to bear in mind that Nigeria is a secular nation, and that in choosing their running mates, another Muslim would not be tolerated. “Nigeria belongs to all of us, and every part of the country and religion is important. Choosing Muslims as their running mates will amount to neglecting Christians,” Nwachukwu said. While the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) recently chose Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, a northern Muslim as presidential candidate, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) settled for a southern Muslim, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. The Bishop charged Christians all over the country to ensure they have their PVCs, saying this is not the time not to be interested about whether to participate in electoral processes or not. He told his congregation that their only chance of participating in choosing a leader for the country was by participating in the ongoing voter registration exercise. He also called on INEC to make the process seamless for the people, noting that the electorates were now aware and ready to participate in the processes that would lead to the enthronement of a new leader in 2023. The Bishop blamed the resurgence of idolatry on recent barbaric killings in the country, especially the attack in Owo, Ondo State, saying it was targeted at Christianity as a religion, while urging to rise up and fight their battle spiritually.
