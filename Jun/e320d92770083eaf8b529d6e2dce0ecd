 When faced with the ups and downs of politics in Nigeria, one can only sigh and tell the younger generation to eat the heart of lions before coming forward to be a politician. As somebody who has been in the thick of things for a long time, the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Adebayo Adelabu, doubtlessly had others warn him. Alas, truth only becomes apparent looking back. There was a time when Adelabu was the bride of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State. That was when he held administrative power in his hands and could throw out inspirational speeches (and the occasional snide remark at his adversaries) whenever he felt like it. However, now, even if he screamed at the top of his voice and used the voice of thunder, only a handful would give him any kind of ovation, let alone a standing one. All of this is because Providence appears to have left the tent of Adelabu. Instead, this embodiment of fortune and grace has lighted upon the tent of Adelabu’s political opponent, Teslim Folarin. Unsurprisingly, many of Adelabu’s close associates promptly abandoned him, no longer amused by his grand speeches and grander gesticulations. It is nobody’s fault that Adelabu lost the Oyo APC gubernatorial ticket to Folarin. Some would say – actually, they have said – that Folarin is the better politician by a large margin. In other words, no amount of weeping can bring back Adelabu’s hope of becoming Oyo Governor come 2023. Similarly, no kind of cross-carpeting to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) can achieve the same effect, at least, this is what some political analysts have claimed. Nevertheless, a loss is easier to bear when there are friends to bear it with. Alas, Adelabu’s friends have allegedly left him for greener pastures. Then again, this mirrors what happened in 2019 when he lost to Seyi Makinde. So, maybe Adelabu is used to it?
