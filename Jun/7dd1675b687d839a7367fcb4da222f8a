 Indeed, great people are not daunted by where they come from. In the eyes of excellent individuals, backgrounds only serve as the beginning of one’s journey; they say nothing about where one would end up. This has been proven to be true in the life of Tokunbo Ogundeyin, the man that has risen from nothing to become one of the most prominent Nigerians straddling with equal mastery both the business and the defence industries. There was a time when nobody knew the name, history, and ambitions of the man behind Proforce. When he did come into the limelight, it was as the person in charge of the O’la Kleen Holdings Conglomerate, a company that only offered cleaning services to many major Nigerian firms. Once seen as an exalted janitor, Ogundeyin has gradually metamorphosed into a household name in and out of Nigeria. Not so long ago, it came to light that Ogundeyin was the brains behind Proforce, a company that specialises in manufacturing armoured vehicles for the Nigerian Army and provides other equipment and services to bolster the security offerings of the defence industry. Ever since, Ogundeyin has gained national renown, going from ‘one of us’ to a paragon of industry. Recently, Ogundeyin’s brilliance exploded beyond the shores of Nigeria. According to reports, his Proforce had managed to secure a deal with Belarus, a country in Eastern Europe. As expected, Proforce has been tasked with making available defence equipment, possibly armoured vehicles, for the Belarusian government, a task that will doubtless further cast Ogundeyin’s name and work abroad. Indeed, Ogundeyin’s strides are nothing short of gigantic. After all, he has managed to do something that even the Nigerian government has been labouring to do for a long time: show Nigeria as a country that is capable enough to be useful and domineering in times of war. What greater evidence of Ogundeyin’s worth is there than this?
