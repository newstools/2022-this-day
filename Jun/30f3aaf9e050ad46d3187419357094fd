 Air Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao is the 21st Chief of Air Staff. He has, over the years, served in critical sectors in the military which has enabled him to contribute significantly to the development of the Nigerian Air Force whilst acquiring a unique perspective and insight that has shaped his strategic thoughts. Upon assumption of office on January 26, 2021, Chiemelie Ezeobi reports that his focus has been on doctrinal development and application of airpower in joint military operations, purposeful training and human capacity development as well as platforms and equipment serviceability through innovative maintenance methods and logistics support systems Until his appointment as the 21st Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) by President Muhammadu Buhari on January 26, 2021, Air Marshal Amao was the Commandant of the Armed Forces Resettlement Centre (NAFRC), Oshodi, a key institution tasked with the responsibility of training and empowering military personnel for post-service re-integration into the civil society. VisionBearing in mind the current security environment as well as the mission of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), “To ensure the integrity of the airspace by gaining and maintaining control of the air while retaining a credible capacity to fulfill other airpower tasks demanded by national defence and security imperatives,” Air Marshal Oladayo Amao coined his vision for the NAF which seeks, “To enhance and sustain critical airpower capabilities required for joint force employment in pursuit of national security imperatives”. Key Drivers To give bite to his vision, the NAF Director of Public  Relations (DOPRI), Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, noted that the CAS fashioned out five main key drivers which laid emphasis on doctrinal development and application of airpower in joint military operations, purposeful training and human capacity development as well as platforms and equipment serviceability through innovative maintenance methods and logistics support systems.Other areas of emphasis include ensuring a disciplined workforce essential for combat readiness and bolstering troop morale by improving personnel welfare. Achievements So Far Thus, upon assumption of office, Air Marshal Amao had assured Nigerians that under his watch, the NAF alongside the sister services would redouble its effort at providing the support and security necessary for the nation’s development, whilst discharging its constitutional responsibilities to the government and law-abiding citizens.Also, one of his key derivatives was that NAF under his leadership would leverage credible partnerships while focusing on enhancing professionalism so as to promote performance and motivate initiatives that would create an enabling environment for successful operations.Over time, not only has he focused on such collaborations, he also capitalised on critically applying the principles of war, personnel motivation and inter-service cooperation, which is a time-tested doctrine capable of bringing the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) closer to achieving the core mandate of securing the nation.In terms of fighting insurgency and terrorism, the CAS through the NAF has sustained some gains. Besides supporting joint operations, the NAF has also conducted independent operations to destroy insurgents’ capabilities. In March 2022 for instance, aerial operations by the NAF Component of Operation Thunder Strike and Operation Gama Aiki eliminated over 150 terrorists who had been under surveillance for some time and were observed to be in three different groups of approximately 40 terrorists, with at least 25 motorcycles per group. However, rather than strike individual group separately, the NAF surveillance team patiently waited until the three groups gathered at a crossroad location near Ghana Village. According to the Niger State Commissioner for Local Government, Community Development, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal Security, Emmanuel Umar, many commanders of the terrorist groups were killed in the operations, pointing out that the eliminated terrorists belonged to the camps of Ali Kawajo, Yello Janbros, Kachalla Halilu and Bello Turji. Similar successes have also been recorded in Operational theatres in the North-east, North-west and Southern parts of the Country. All these wouldn’t have been possible without adequate platforms enabled by the magnanimity of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, which ensured that the NAF under Air Marshal Amao acquired new platforms while reactivating existing ones.According to Air Commodore Gabkwet, under Air Marshal Amao, the NAF has witnessed a tremendous boost to its aircraft holdings across various fleets. In addition to the previously acquired platforms, the NAF has, in 2021 alone, taken delivery of 15 brand new aircraft and Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV) and have sustained reactivation of hitherto unserviceable platforms to upscale its capabilities in tackling all forms of criminality.The latest additions of three JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter aircraft and 12 A-29 Super Tucano aircraft recently inducted into the NAF Order of Battle are presently deployed in various theatres of operation across the country to add impetus to the ongoing war against insurgency, armed banditry and other forms of criminality in the country.A champion of human capital, Air Marshal Amao also ensured the NAF Special Forces elements were reinvigorated and further given advanced training both at home and abroad.The NAF has also boosted the capacity of its Regiment and Special Forces with additional training and equipment to improve operations in the fight against insurgency and other forms of criminality. In the last 15 months, the service has also enhanced its recruitment drive by graduating over additional 2,500 recruits at the Military Training Centre in Kaduna, just as it sent 10 Senior Non-Commissioned Officers of the ranks of Air Warrant Officer and Master Warrant Officer to the United Kingdom for a unique four-part international pre-retirement training.Meanwhile, in the past 15 months, NAF has winged 56 pilots and operators who graduated from various pilot courses both at home and abroad. In the same vein, several officers, airmen and airwomen of the NAF are currently undergoing different types of training in various countries including the United States of America, South Africa, India, Belgium, Egypt and Pakistan, amongst others. A firm believer in welfare of officers and men, the CAS has gone out of his way to boost the morale of personnel by ensuring that they are well taken care of, accomodation-wise, as well as schools attended by their children. Also, to enable NAF personnel and those outside the service the opportunity to channel their complaints and grievances against the service or its personnel, the CAS during the year established the Office of the Ombudsman and the Directorate of Veterans Affairs (DVA).Meanwhile, in its bid to reduce the huge foreign exchange expended on medical tourism, the NAF leadership approved the setting up a NAF Telemedicine portal to bridge the geographical barriers between patient and healthcare provider to access efficient and affordable healthcare services without being physically involved. Given the invaluable role of Research and Development, the CAS has invested substantially in R&D to develop unprecedented capacity to surmount current and emerging security challenges while also enhancing its operational viability. CAS has also placed premium on key infrastructural development for all NAF bases, as well as units and commands, inadvertently boosting morale of troops. In all, Air Marshal Amao in tandem in with his vision and mission for the NAF is on course to ensure holistic fire power for the Nigerian Air Force while ensuring no doctrine or key derivative is left undone.
