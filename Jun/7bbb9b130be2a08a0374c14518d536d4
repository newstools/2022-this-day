 After the initial claim of factionalisation of the Labour Party (LP), Mr. Peter Obi was yesterday handed the certificate of return as the standard bearer of the Labour Party for the 2023 presidential election. According to a tweet from the party’s official Tweeter handle @NgLabour said, “Mr. Peter Obi Receives Labour Party Certificate of Returns as its Presidential Candidate for 2023 presidential elections. Congratulations!!” “Dr. Peter Obi arrives Labour Party National Office Abuja to receive his Presidential Certificate of Returns as Labour Party Presidential Candidate. Stay tuned…” the Tweet had announced. Prior to the Tweet on the handing over of the party flag and certificate of return to Obi, the party had gleefully announced his arrival at their office apparently to debunk reports that another faction had produced a candidate.
