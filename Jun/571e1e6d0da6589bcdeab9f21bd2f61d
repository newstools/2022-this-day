 Hammed Shittu in Ilorin Kwara State Governor, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has said there is no doubt that the ‘O To Ge’ (enough is enough) administration has  restored the dignity of the average person, and placed the state on the path of steady growth and competitiveness among its peers. In a statement issued in Ilorin yesterday, which was signed by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Rafiu Ajakaye, to mark the celebration of this year democracy day, the governor stated that: “The future is indeed bright, as we build on our successes over the next few years. Kwarans are vigilant and are willing to consolidate on the gains of the past three years. The statement read: “I join our compatriots worldwide to commemorate the June 12 Democracy Day, which was named in honour of the many heroes and heroines of civil rule, especially the late Moshood Kashimawo Abiola. “This day reminds us of a chapter in our history when Nigerians forged a common front for democratic rule in expectations of a greater homeland. “A product of a people’s struggle through the ballot box, our administration in Kwara State aligns with the dream of the ordinary person who simply yearns for a life more abundantly. “This explains our focus on giving every Kwara State child the right foundation to attain their potential, providing affordable and qualitative healthcare, pioneering a decent safety net programme for the vulnerable poor, giving equitable opportunities to all genders and steadily bridging the huge development gaps in our state.” The statement read further that:  “Having taken Kwara State out of the era of wanton stealing of public property, non-payment of salary and genuine entitlements of workers while a few persons lived large on pubic patrimony, and total collapse of public amenities across the state, we are glad that the ‘O To Ge’ administration has restored the dignity of the average person and placed the state on the path of steady growth and competitiveness among its peers.”
