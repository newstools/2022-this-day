StateCraft win came with its ‘DrawTheLine’ (DTL) against malaria campaign which was executed in Nigeria on behalf of global charity, Malaria No More UK (MNMUK). The campaign also received a Certificate of Excellence in the Best West Africa PR Campaigns category. The SABRE Awards rewards superior achievement in marketing and public relations. It is recognised as the global benchmark for excellence in the industry. Commenting, Chief Executive Officer of StateCraft, Adebola Williams said, “We appreciate this recognition which underlines our consistency in deploying media as a tool of nation-building. As a people, we must collectively establish and support platforms such as SABRE which enable us put proper perspective on our narrative, while telling the stories that create impact within and outside our continent.” Launched in 2021, the DTL campaign supports the growing ‘Zero Malaria Starts with Me’ movement. It reflects the human story of malaria and the devastating impact it has on education, employment, health, and prospects of Africa’s growing young population. Celebrity ambassadors including David Beckham, Yemi Alade, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, Meji Alabi, Osas Ighodaro and Laolu Senbanjo were among those that featured on the campaign.
