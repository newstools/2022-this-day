 Michael Olugbode in Abuja A respected legal icon in the country, Yusuf Ali has expressed readiness to rally his professional colleagues to give essential support to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in the interest of socio-economic development of the country. The anti-narcotics agency had recently come under attack from a section of the country for advocating for drug test of intending married couples, politicians and members of the youth corps. Ali, who is a Senior Advocate of Nigeria(SAN), on Wednesday during a courtesy visit on the Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) in Abuja, disclosed that  his decision to support agency was borne out of his appreciation of the good works Marwa is leading his officers and men to do for the country as well as his conviction that overcoming Nigeria’s drug scourge is key to solving the security challenges facing the nation. The legal luminary while commending Marwa for recalibrating NDLEA and making it an effective frontline agency,expressed readiness to support the agency either at personal or official levels to ensure the drug war is given priority that it deserves by his professional friends. In his response, Marwa thanked him for the visit. He said whatever has been achieved in NDLEA has been largely due to the support and commitment of the officers and men of the agency. He said the agency would hold further talks with the legal luminary on areas of assistance especially in the prosecution of some high profile cases in court. The NDLEA boss seized the opportunity to decorate the SAN as a War Against Drug Abuse (WADA) Special Ambassador.
