 Laleye Dipo in Minna The immediate past Chairman of the Niger State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Reverend Mathias Echioda, has tasked Nigerian Christians to ensure they obtain their Permanent Voters Card (PVCs) and also cast their ballots for candidates of the political party of their choice in all next general election. Echioda gave the admonition in Minna, the state capital, last Sunday while exchanging views with journalists after delivering the sermon at the Special Service organised by the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church headquarters to mark this year Father’s Day celebration. Echioda said Christians should stop the idea of showing nonchalant attitude to elections, but only to complain of bad governance later. According to him, “Your PVC is the power to install any type of government you want, because without the PVC, you cannot vote.” The clergyman argued that Christianity does not stop adherents of the religion from either participating in politics or voting, saying the only thing is that Christians should not partake in doing unreligious and illegal things. The former CAN chairman also spoke against the rise in youth restiveness in some parts of Minna, and called on the state government to nip the trend in the bud before it escalates. According to him, “Youth gangs now take control of parts of Minna on a daily basis, wreaking havoc and threatening the lives of innocent members of the public,” saying the time to put the issue under check is now. In his sermon, Reverend Echioda tasked fathers as heads of the families to wake up to their responsibilities, adding that the wayward behaviours of the youths can be traced to the negligence of the fathers. He said a good father should be able to mold the character of their children, teach them the way of the Lord, and encourage them to be honest and trustworthy citizens. Meanwhile, a drama on the role of a father was presented by the drama unit of the church to mark the event.
