 Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja A political group, the Presidential Support Committee (PSC) has said that Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the only person capable of sustaining the legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari. The group delivered the assessment yesterday at a press conference addressed in Abuja by its National President, Hon. Gideon Sammani and National Publicity Secretary, Dr. Mohammad Kailani, in the wake of the emergence of Tinubu as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in next year’s presidential election. Kailani said Tinubu, who garnered 1,271 votes from the delegates at the just concluded APC Presidential Primary Convention at the Eagle Square, Abuja, thoroughly deserved his mandate and was very familiar with the party. He also added that by emerging as APC presidential candidate, Tinubu’s chances of winning the election next year are bright because he is somebody who has the interest of the people at heart. “In addition you will see from the landslide victory at the convention where he came out with 1,271 votes. These are the votes of the delegates from the whole nation, including the North. If you look at the North, the whole North-west is for Asiwaju, Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi, Kaduna and Bornu in the North-east. He deserves this mandate. One good turn deserves another. He is the only one that can carry out the legacies of Mr. President and he knows this party,” Kailani said. He also commended the wisdom of the National Coordinator of the PSC, Senator Godswill Akpabio, for stepping down from the race and for being the first to publicly join forces with Tinubu to achieve his landmark electoral victory. He urged the entire PSC members and indeed over 40 million registered members of the party to evolve internal mechanisms for mass mobilisation of voters for the support of Tinubu in next year’s election.
