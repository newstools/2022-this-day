 Meanwhile, the National Chairman of Labour Party, Julius Abure has advised INEC to deploy more officials to improve on and expedite the process of registering more Nigerian voters to make them eligible for the 2023 general elections. Abure made the appeal yesterday, during a telephone interview with THISDAY, noting that a lot of Nigerians who had been eager to register in the last few weeks have not been able to do so. He said giving the pressure on the Commission by Nigerians, there was need to improve on continuous voters’ registration, “because a lot of young people who wanted to register have not been able to do so in the past two weeks across the country.” “You know registration is the Commission’s pre- condition for people to have their PVCs and then to be able to participate in the election. “We want to appeal to INEC that they should deploy more officials to the field to continue with the registration of prospective voters,” he added. Abure also expressed confidence that INEC would not be overwhelmed by the pressure from perspective voters and it preparation for next year’s general elections.
