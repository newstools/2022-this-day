 Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa The national leadership of the Movement for Survival of the Izon Ethnic Nationality in Niger Delta (MOSIEND) has warned politicians to play by the rule and desist from dragging the name of the group into the political arena. A group of politicians against the presidential aspiration of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu had in a statement credited to an unknown national spokesman of MOSIEND, Kakas Ambgare, purportedly calling on the people of the Niger Delta region not to support the APC presidential candidate. But the National Secretary of MOSIEND, Winston Amain, in a statement issued yesterday condemned in strong terms the ill-calculated move by Ambgare and his sponsors aimed at tarnishing the good reputation of the movement. According to Amain, any statement or positions not made known by its National spokesperson, Charles Omusuku, on critical regional and national issues is fake. Amain reiterated that MOSIEND remains a socio-ethnic pressure group that is providing purposeful leadership for the recovery of lost grounds “in taking our Ijaw Nation cum Niger Delta to greater heights. MOSIEND would not meddle into party politics as portrayed by the said Prince Kakas Ambgare and his cohorts in their statements. “The public must be aware that Charles Omusuku remains the only authentic national spokesman of MOSIEND, and must be acknowledged as such. “The MOSIEND leadership, therefore, sends a strong warning to all those behind the said impersonation to discontinue forthwith, or be ready to face the full wrath of the movement,” stressing that MOSIEND will no longer tolerate such mischievous act from anybody or group under any guise. The movement urged the public to discountenance any publication from the said Kakas Ambgare parading himself as the national spokesperson of the movement, “which he is not,” while also calling on the security agencies not to push this aside but bring those behind the act to book.”
