To achieve the results that we know we are capable of, as a party, we must secure broad support across our diverse and divided nation. We must compete and win at the local, state, and federal levels. We will do this because our secret weapon as PRP is our people and their commitment to our great party and its ethical foundations. I promise to campaign with every PRP candidate, from the ward, local government to state level, to achieve our collective goals,” he said.He stated that his choice as the party’s flag-bearer indicates that the country was moving closer to the promised land that his late father and PRP founders dreamt of.He explained that his emergence as president would prove to be a bridge-builder for the next generation and future of leadership in Nigeria.
