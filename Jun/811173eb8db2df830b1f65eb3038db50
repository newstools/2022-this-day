 The elected Chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, ICAN’s Ilupeju/Gbagada and District Society (IGDS), Prof. Godwin Oyedokun has urged fraud examiners in both the public and private sectors to be more strategic in fighting fraud and corruption to nip the situation in the bud. Oyedokun identified this in his new book, “Determinant of Forensic Accounting: Techniques and Theories.” The book is scheduled for public presentation on June 25, 2022 during the investiture of Oyedokun as the 2nd Chairman of IGDS by the Institute past President, Chiding Ajaebu. Oyedokun was elected alongside other executives at the first Annual General Meeting of IGDS held in Lagos recently. The author noted that the book would complement efforts to fight fraud in the country while also extending the frontiers of knowledge in Forensic Accounting and Taxation. He said, “The book guides readers to the level of various crimes committed, how much is involved, stages and complexity of fraud, the primary techniques used in forensic accounting and fraud examination engagements, as well as other dimensions to determine forensic accounting techniques and theories.” Speaking, outgoing and Pioneer Chairman of IGDS, Gbenga Omidiji urged the incoming chairman to keep to the ideals and philosophies of the institute, as well as liaising with the community on issues affecting taxation. On his part, a Founding Pillar of IGDS, Tobi Abiola avowed the leadership of the new chairman and other executives to lead the district to enviable heights. He said, “The executives were elected based on their capability, performance and contributions to the Institute at the district levels and the community.”
