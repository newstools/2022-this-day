Many of them attended the training session and they are now well informed about the operational standard of the courier industry. Some however were defiant and refused to attend the training and they still violate the rules with impunity. Those are the illegal courier operators that we are clamping down and we will continue the clampdown till we get the courier and logistics industry fully sanitised,” Shonde said.
