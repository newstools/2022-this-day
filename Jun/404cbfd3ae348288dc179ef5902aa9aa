 Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Katsina Area Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has said it has generated over N104.7 million from export and import duties for the federal government barely three months after reopening the Nigeria/Niger Republic border at Jibia, Katsina State. Briefing journalists in Katsina on its ongoing war against smuggling, the Command’s Comptroller, Dalha Wada Chedi, said the whooping sum generated by the command has been paid into the federal government’s account. The NCS, had in April 2022, reopened the Nigeria/Niger Republic border at Jibia, Jibia Local Government Area of the state for legitimate businesses to thrive between the two countries. Chedi said: “With the reopening of the Jibia border, the command is expected to discharge all its statutory obligations which include control of import and export through the reopened border by adhering to Customs procedures in collection of revenue and other regulations. “Consequently, the total sum of N104, 735, 574.00 was collected and paid into the federal government account within the period under review.” He said the worth of export through the Jibia border within the period under review for 4,000 metric tonnes of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and 1,000 metric tonnes of cement is N998,205,392.04 and N32,292,830.00. He added that the command also seized N38.5 million worth of contraband between May 1, 2022 to date, adding that it has recorded a decline in the number of seizures due to the reopening of the border. Other factors that led to the decline in the seizures, according to him, were restrategised operation procedures on anti-smuggling activities by frequent patrols, surveillance and intelligence gathering and synergy among security agencies, government and stakeholders at border communities. He, however, called on the business community in the state to comply with all the import and export guidelines for a seamless importation and exportation through the reopened border.
