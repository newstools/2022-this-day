This passion and commitment drove her activities throughout her life and were exemplified in the roles she played and the responsibilities that she took on. They said: “We will hold on to the memory of Raheemat Omoro Momodu in death as we valued her in life.  Among the fond memories was her dynamic leadership of the Lagos State Chapter of the NAWOJ the 1990s as the chairperson during which she became a vital ally in the establishment of the New Trend Movement in the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ).” “As we learn to cope with the pain of her exit, we will exult and celebrate everyday the memories she left for us. That retention of a friend, more of a sister, who was always there. That of a loyal, jovial, generous and dependable friend, associate and colleague.” Hajia  Momodu was  buried yesterday  at the Gwarimpa Muslim Cemetery opposite old War College Quarters Gate, Abuja.
