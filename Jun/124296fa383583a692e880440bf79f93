 Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja A former governor of Borno state, Kashim Shettima, has warned that it would be “catastrophic” for the All Progressives Congress (APC) if the  former Lagos governor state, Bola Tinubu  isn’t elected as the party’s presidential candidate. Shettima stated this on Friday while featuring on a programme on TVC. The former governor said whether APC members admit it or not, Tinubu has paid his dues as a party member. His words: “We are in a democratic situation but I’m afraid it might be catastrophic for the party. I’m not a prophet of doom; I’m an eternal optimist. We have done our own bidding and by God’s grace, our candidate will emerge as the presidential flag bearer of the APC  in the next 72 hours,” he said. “It is not a subject of dispute but a question of time. He has paid the price, and yesterday in Abeokuta, he made some remarks that were deliberately distorted and quoted out of context. “Whether they are willing to admit it or not, he played a pivotal role not only in the emergence of President Muhammadu Buhari as the candidate of the APC, but in the ultimate election in 2015.”
