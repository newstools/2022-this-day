The royal father made this known while speaking at his palace yesterday when received in audience the United Nations (UN) Special Envoy, Mr. Phillip Bonn African Edward, and the Grand Patron of Shuiabu Abubakar Audu Foundation, Shuibu Abubakar Audu, who is the son of the late governor in Okene. He lauded the grand patron of Shuaibu Audu Foundation, Shuaibu Audu, for stepping into his late father’s shoe in philanthropic activities in the state. The monarch explained that late Audu was so passionate about the development of Kogi State, noting that he was a great gentleman whose style of governance has distinguished the state among the committee of states in Nigeria. According to him, “You are my son, and that is why I am not surprised at what you are doing in the state and Nigeria by extension. Just know that I am and will always be with you at any time.” The Ohinoyi further promised to confer traditional title on the UN special envoy, Edward, at a later date. Speaking earlier, Shuaibu Audu said the Foundation is operating in three thematic areas of Health, Economy and Education.
