 Juan Mata will leave Manchester United on a free transfer when his contract expires this summer. The 34-year-old midfielder who helped Spain win the 2010 World Cup, cost United a then club-record £37.1mwhen he joined from Chelsea in 2014. Mata, who scored 51 goals in 285 appearances for United, played in seven Premier League games last season. The club announced on Wednesday that Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard would be leavingOld Trafford this summer. “Thank you for dedicating eight years of your career to United, Juan,” the club said. “Everyone at the club wishes you all the best for the future.” Mata, who agreed a one-year contract extension with United last July, won four trophies with the club, including the FA Cup in 2016, and the Community Shield, League Cup and Europa League in the 2016-17 season.
