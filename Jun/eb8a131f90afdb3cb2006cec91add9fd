 Olawale Ajimotokan Nigeria’s only professional golfer on the Ladies European Tour, Georgia Oboh, has made the cut into the main tournament at ShopRite LPGA Classic billed to tee off tomorrow at the 6,155 yards long Stockton Seaview Hotel and Golf Club Bay Course, Galloway New Jersey. The 20-year-old Oboh fired two over par 73 over the Bay Course to trail the winner of the qualifying tournament, American Vicky Hurst into the main event. They will be joined by 21 other projected qualifiers for the 54-hole stroke play tournament. After dropping shots on the second and third holes, Oboh held her nerves, zipping in four birdies on the back nine to ease into the main round of the tournament.
