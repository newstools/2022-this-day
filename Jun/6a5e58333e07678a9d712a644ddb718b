Tribute  Alex Enumah He came. He saw. He conquered. Those words are a befitting epitaph for the legal luminary and environmentalist Lucius Ezeakammadu Nwosu (SAN). He brought many joys to Niger Delta communities. But for the late Nwosu, many communities in the Niger Delta would have been wiped out by environmental degradation occasioned by oil companies’ operations. The late Nwosu was a rare gem. He championed environmental causes even to his personal cross. Having a father who worked for Shell Petroleum Development Company and one who himself worked with the oil giant while as a secondary school student, one would have expected that the fiery lawyer would have, upon graduation from university, sought a juicy position in any of the major oil companies but, rather chose to be on the other side in other to fight the rising issue of environmental and oil pollution in the Niger Delta region. Although the light may be said to have dimmed for one of Nigeria’s respected environmental rights lawyers and philanthropists, no doubt the late senior lawyer left his marks on the sand of times. He hailed from Udo Ezihinitte Mbaise Local Government Area of Imo State. He attended St. Nicholas Primary School, Oro-Evo, Woji, Port Harcourt, Rivers State from 1958 to 1961, All Saints Primary School, Udo, Ezinihitte Mbaise from 1962 to 1963, Mater Miseri Cordae Primary School, Rumoamasi, Obio-Akpor, Port Harcourt, Rivers State from 1964 to 1965. He was also at Our Lady Lourdes Secondary School, Ozuoba, Port Harcourt, Birabi Memorial Grammar School, Bori-Ogoni, from 1966 to 1967 and Government College Umuahia, Abia State. Barrister Nwosu began working while he was a secondary school student, employed as a contract staff in the Land and Legal Department of the Shell British Petroleum Company of Nigeria Limited in 1973 and in the Hydrocarbon Division of the Federal Ministry of Mines and Power, Port Harcourt from October 1975 to September 1976. After secondary school, he engaged in personal studies. He obtained his GCE ‘A’ Level and proceeded to the University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus, where he studied law from 1976 to 1980. He did his law school programme at the Nigerian Law school Victoria Island, Lagos. He was called to the Nigerian Bar in July 1981. After qualifying as a lawyer, Nwosu commenced his legal practice as a member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in the law firm of D. A Akintoye & Co, Ilorin, Kwara State from 1981 to 1982. From August 1982 to 1986, he delved into rigorous legal practice, starting as a junior counsel at Sotonye-Denton West & Co. In August 1986, he established the law firm of Lucius E. Nwosu & Partners with the firm’s range of practice and expertise spanning tortuous hydrocarbon environmental law, bankruptcy, conversion of landed hereditaments, oil and gas law, energy, corporate law and real estate. Like any Port Harcourt boy, Nwosu loved the city but was enraged by the misfortune that oil brought to his birth’s otherwise “garden city” of his birth. To his chagrin, there were no gardens left in Port Harcourt; instead, soothing now falls from the skies on everything from its polluted environment. Proximity to this environmental anomaly and tragedy compelled Lucius Nwosu to act rather than flee. From then on, he devoted his legal mind to fighting for environmental justice for the helpless people of the oil-rich Niger Delta. Barrister Nwosu was married to Dr. (Mrs.) Chinelo J. Nwosu and the union is blessed with five children. His hobbies included boating and travelling. As one of Nigeria’s foremost environmental law specialists and practitioners, Nwosu applied his brilliance, doggedness, perseverance, and selflessness to offer excellent legal services to his various clients, particularly the Niger-Delta communities. He waged many battles against environmental degradation and pollution, battles through which he often obtained reprieve for communities in the oil-producing regions of Nigeria. Characteristically he often worked for these communities on a contingency basis. He disliked placing a burden on his clients by demanding professional fees before rendering his outstanding professional services. Amongst his remarkable cases to his credit were the SPDC vs Farah (1995)3 NWLR Pt.382, where he contributed significantly to jurisprudence in the area of heads of claim in compensation matters; and consolidated suit number FHC/PH/CS/84 & 85/94: Chief T. Edamkue vs SPDC, in which he contributed significantly to jurisprudence in the area of representative actions and heads of claim in compensation matters recovered damages in torts arising from the spillage of crude hydrocarbon from the polluter for the Duboro and the Baen communities of Ogoni land. The decision of the Federal High Court was upheld by the Supreme Court and reported as SPDC vs Edamkue (2009) LPELR- 3048(SC). There were also the consolidated suit numbers FHC/CA/CS/30/98 and FHC/CA/31/98: Chief (Hon.) Simeon Monokpo & ANOR vs Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited & ANOR, where he contributed significantly to jurisprudence in trial proceedings in Civil Litigation and recovered damages in torts arising from the spillage of crude hydrocarbon from the polluter for his Ogoni and Ikot Abasi Clients. The decision of the Federal High Court was appealed to the Supreme Court (SC/20/2001), where the apex court ordered a trial de novo. The suits (subsequently renumbered as FHC/UY/CS/57 & 58/2004) were settled out of court as the polluter preferred not to face Nwosu in a fresh trial. There was also suit number FHC/PH/CS/248/98 – His Majesty, Chief (Dr.) Alfred Papapreye Diete-Spiff & 7 ORS vs Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited & Mobil Incorporation of USA, where he obtained a judgment from the Federal High Court and eventually recovered damages in torts arising from the spillage of crude hydrocarbon from the polluter for the peoples of Twon Brass in Brass Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. There many other significant cases he won. List of Significant Cases Won by Lucius Ezeakammadu Nwosu (SAN) 1.
