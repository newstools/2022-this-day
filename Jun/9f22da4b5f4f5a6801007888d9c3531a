 The above captioned piece, published by THISDAY on Tuesday, June 20, 2022, has an egregious error. I got 589 votes in the primary. Dumebi Kachiku got 977. Chukwuka Monye, who came third, got 339 votes. So the judgment “In other words, Kachikwu got triple the number of votes that Moghalu obtained. It was, by definition, a trouncing” is erroneous as a matter of fact. I believe this piece, just like several reactions I have received from Nigeria, shows the wisdom in my restraint in not getting down to the mud with Kachikwu. Prof Kingsley Moghalu, @MoghaluKingsley
