When I contested as governor in Anambra I did so in a small party. People told me that I had no structure. People are the structure. When I was a governor of Anambra state, my party had no state or federal lawmaker and when i left as governor no state was financially stable as Anambra. We were not owing anybody. The people will decide who will rule them.”Obi, however, urged other presidential aspirants; “come and tell us, don’t use people or glossy paper, tell us from your mouth so that we can hold you to account.”Also speaking at the conference, the National Secretary of the Young Peoples Party ( YPP), Barrister Vidi Bamaiyi, maintained that 75 per cent of politicians in Nigeria are political bandits.“Political bandits that have taken over Nigeria, most of them have no business being there. Political bandits have taken over the political space,” he added.In his remark, former Akwa Ibom State Commissioner of Finance, Senator Albert Bassey, said only through direct primaries will the country eliminate money politics saying: “Going forward, Nigerians should vote for candidates and not party. “
