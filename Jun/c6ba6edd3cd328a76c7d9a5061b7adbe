  It used to be said that women were only half of what men will ever be. But most of the people who said and thought such things are long gone and mostly forgotten. The fire of feminine brilliance in business and society, however, continues to burn. So, even as Titan Trust Bank is gaining renown as a budding giant in Nigeria’s banking sector, it is important to point out some of the brains behind the bank’s growth. One of such individuals is Adaeze Udensi, the bank’s Executive Director. It has to be said that women are gradually taking over the high seats in Nigeria’s banking sector and other branches of the gigantic corporate tree. Nevertheless, Udensi stands out as one who is in a pioneer position, striving alongside the founding members of Titan Trust Bank to establish a legacy of an institution. She may not be superlatively wealthy, but what she brings to the administrative table of Titan Trust is even more precious. Accompanying Udensi is more than two decades of active experience in the financial industry. This portfolio covers more than the banking industry and reaches into retail, commerce and e-business, private wealth management, business development, credit, marketing, and even the public sector. Udensi’s genius beats that of most of her peers and sets her as the crème de la crème of Titan Trust Bank’s brainiacs, a reputation that she tries to keep under wraps as she focuses on her job as Executive Director. One only needs to look at Heritage Bank (where she was the Executive Compliance Officer and was in charge of the South-South/South-East Directorate) and Zenith Bank (where she oversaw the bank’s expansion into oil and gas, the public sector, commerce, retail operations, etc.) to know Udensi’s worth. In a way, it is not all that surprising that Titan Trust Bank is already on its way to the top. With people like Udensi around, Titan Trust can only become a first-tier Nigerian bank.
