 Laleye Dipo in Minna The Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has been advised to ignore the counsel of Kaduna State Governor, Mr. Nasir Elrufai, that he should settle for a Muslim as his running mate. A Former Publicity Secretary of the APC in Niger State, Mr. Jonathan Tsado Vatsa, said that Tinubu would lost the election if he listens to El-Rufai. In a statement titled “The Christians are Awake and Alive in Nigeria Ahead of 2023 General Elections,” Vatsa warned the APC flag bearer against picking the Kaduna State governor as his running mate. He said: “This country called Nigeria has grown past what people like El-Rufai thinks. A Muslim-Muslim presidential team can never work in Nigeria,” Vatsa, who was also a former Commissioner for Information and Strategy in Niger State,  declared, before asking Tinubu to disregard El-Rufai “because no Christian in Nigeria will vote for Tinubu if he goes ahead with Muslim-Muslim ticket. “Our National Leader and Presidential flag Bearer, Bola Tinubu, is more intelligent than him. He is politically wiser than El-Rufai, he knows everybody’s antecedent so he cannot be deceived. “Tinubu knows that Muslim-Muslim ticket will spell doom for him and APC in 2023.” He reminded Tinubu that “there are very intelligent, competent and highly respected Christians in the north that can be Vice President,” adding that “those who have turned their state to war zone should not dream of becoming vice president of this country.” He also described the Kaduna state Governor as the “most unqualified person” to be picked as Tinubu’s running mate” because he has not been able to manage the religious and ethnic diversities in his state. In a recent interview Governor Nasir Elrufai had urged the APC standard bearer to settle for a Muslum-Muslim presidential ticket. The Kaduna State Governor is among the numerous APC members pushing to be picked as Tinubu’s running mate.
