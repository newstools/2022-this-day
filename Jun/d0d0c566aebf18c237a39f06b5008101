 James Sowole in Abeokuta The Senator representing Ogun Central in the National Assembly, Ibikunle Amosun, yesterday appealed to the people of the state to vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 election, saying Nigeria’s problems are surmountable. Amosun, a second term senator, stated this in Abeokuta, Ogun State, while addressing APC chieftains and supporters, who came to welcome him after the presidential primary. The senator said he stepped down for Tinubu in the interest of the South-west region and Nigeria in general. He said if the governors in the North could decide that presidency should come to the South, the best thing to do was to rally round one person, declaring that his interest was for a Southwesterner to emerge as president. Amosun said though there are several challenges in the country covering all sectors, however, all challenges are surmountable, and would soon be a thing of the past. He said the issue of insecurity in the country had overshadowed all the good things that the current administration at the centre is doing. The former state governor noted that he had paid his dues in Ogun State when talking of services to the people of the state. He said with the exception of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, no politician dead or alive has served the state more than him since 1999. Amosun told his supporters that he remains a leader of the APC in the state despite the internal crisis tearing the party apart. According to him, “In Ogun State, since 1999, except for Baba Olusegun Obasanjo, I am not talking of pre-1999, no human being, dead or alive, has served Ogun State the way I have served. I have done eight years as your governor, and by next year it will be my eighth year in the Senate. Just between 1999 and now, I have served Ogun State with 15 years of my lifetime.”
