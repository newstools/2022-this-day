The APC is getting stronger and more united. The victory of our party in Ekiti is an indication of the confidence of Nigerians in the ability of our great party to deliver quality governance to all.”He charged all APC members within and outside the country to see this as a good omen for the 2023 general election and work assiduously to ensure the party’s victory, continuing the trend with Osun State gubernatorial poll in July. President Buhari also felicitated the people of Ekiti State for the smooth conduct of the election, affirming that they are the real victors as they have been able to freely choose their leader for the next four years. He lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the law enforcement agencies for the preparations put in place, urging them to keep the momentum for future elections.
