NATIONS LEAGUE  Erling Haaland continued his prolific international form with two goals as Norway beat Sweden in an entertaining Nations League Group B4 encounter. The inbound Manchester City forward headed in to open the scoring in the first half and doubled Norway’s lead from the spot after the break. It takes him to 20 goals in 21 games and he is just 14 away from being the top men’s scorer in Norway’s history. The 21-year-old also set up Norway’s third as Alexander Sorloth made it 3-1. That came after Emil Forsberg pulled one back with a smart finish from Tottenham forward Dejan Kulusevski’s assist, while Viktor Gyokeres set up a nervy finish with another in the 95th minute. Elsewhere, Memphis Depay missed an added-time penalty as Netherlands fell short of completing a famous fightback in a Nations League 2-2 draw against Poland. Louis van Gaal’s side dominated for long periods but fell behind to Matty Cash’s angled drive from 20 yards. Przemyslaw Frankowski then beat the Dutch offside trap to tee up a tap in for Piotr Zielinski to extend the Poles’ lead just after the break. But Davy Klaassen prodded in for the hosts before Denzel Dumfries levelled. And after appearing to be in serious trouble, the Dutch almost made it three wins from three in their Nations League campaign when Cash was adjudged to have handled late on after a VAR check.
