Udora Orizu The Arewa Consultative Youths Movement (ACYM) has hailed the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr Godwin Emefiele, for helping President Muhammadu Buhari to deliver on his economic agenda.  The group, in a statement on Wednesday by its President, Kabiru Yusuf, noted that Buhari himself had admitted in an interview with Bloomberg that Emefiele was doing well. The statement reads, “We commend Dr Emefiele for helping the President to deliver on his economic agenda. We have before now commended Emefiele and his team in the CBN for what they have been doing to reposition the economy. This attestation from the President is no doubt a good one. We urge Emefiele to continue with his good work without minding the antics of detractors who are bent on destabilising the nation’s economy and the country.”
