 Adibe Emenyonu writes on the initiatives by Enageed Resource Limited, a Sahara Group Company, to give free healthcare, ICT Training and capacity building for her host community in Edo State Esther Koma is a community leader in Ajoki, an oil producing community in Ikpoba-Okha  Local Government Area of Edo State. Ajoki is an Itsekiri community in Edo with their larger brothers and sister, living across Delta and Edo States.Considering that the community is located in a remote area of Edo State, it lacks modern amenities even though it is an oil bearing community. But reprieve came to them in February when the Edo State government in collaboration with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and Enageed Resource began the construction of a 17.8km road to connect the community to major towns and cities. This was not all as recently, people of the area benefitted from a free healthcare, ICT training, business development initiative, business registration opportunities and financial independence.Against this backdrop, the community woman leader, Madam Esther Koma said she is extremely grateful to the company for the medical outreach particularly for the elderly, asserting that the treatment she received was very beneficial to her and would enable her carry out her daily duties with ease.Similarly, Michael Ukuyon, the community youth leader and entrepreneur, confessed that the event significantly improved his computer skills and would help him transact his business in line with global standards.No fewer than 600 Ajoki residents and their dependents benefitted from the project which reinforces Enageed’s commitment to  seamless host community relations that promotes economic development, health and safety, and environmental sustainabilityFlagging off the initiative, with sessions aimed at giving residents foundational knowlege on how to improve their various skill sets, pursue self-development goals, Enageed Chief Operating Officer (COO), Mr. Henry Menkiti, disclosed that a sister firm to Enageed, Asharami Energy (a Sahara Group Upstream Company) had invested in the sustainability of its processes and operations to ensure  the safety of residents and facilities in keeping with global standards. Menkiti who noted that this has been instrumental to the cordial relations and economic growth in Ajoki and its environs, declared: “Enageed developed the new initiative to improve the capacity of local community contractors and set their businesses on a steady growth and expansion pedestal. We are proud of our  collaboration with our host communities across all our locations where Enageed is deeply rooted as a proud member and stakeholder.”The Enageed COO, explained that the theme: “Connecting our Communities to Endless Opportunities” reaffirms Enageed’s position that building human and social capital is a never-ending act and is integral to strategic community investments.“Enageed is aware that millions of people around the country have challenges with accessing basic amenities, employment, health care, and education. We are deliberate about the development of our communities. Enageed has assembled seasoned facilitators to provide key lessons on fundamental 21st-century skills and how to leverage Information and Communication Technology (ICT) which continues to change the way we live, work and do business.“To ensure our community contractors have the right skills for an increasingly digital and globalised world, the ICT session which is one of the key components of this training would bridge this gap.“Another key component is the session on financial literacy that is designed to help beneficiaries effectively manage and plot the growth of their businesses. This session would ensure our contractors are more knowledgeable about finance, how to access finance and how to keep their books in a way that is relevant to their business,” he said.Addressing the people on the overview and objectives on local capacity development initiative, the Head of Supply Chain Management, Frank Emeruwa, further noted that the company’s commitment to promoting healthy communities is driving the free  medical screening sessions for members of the community.According to him, “Enageed is unwavering in its commitment to the safety and health of its employees and host communities.  We are hopeful that this session will enlighten the community on how to stay healthy and provide relief for people requiring eye care interventions and other basic health challenges.“We stand ready to ensure continuous development in the communities we operate in, and believe the skills learned and knowledge gained will better equip community contractors to improve the efficiency of their operations and grow their business.
