 Emameh Gabriel interrogates INEC’s readiness for a hitch-free general elections next year. Political parties in the country recently held their primary elections for various elective positions as the nationmove towards another election circle. The public exchange of taunts and dares between supporters ofcandidates for the election have taken a new dimension just as the biles and bites among opposition party’sfaithful have also been raised to the bar.While all of these would linger till the general elections are over next year, attention has however beenshifted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as stakeholders interrogate theCommission’s readiness to conduct a hitch free election come 2023.All this comes against the backdrop of the rise of a Third Force led by youth across regional divide in thecountry, a movement that has put the Commission under pressure to register more Nigerians ahead of theelection.Consequently, Nigerian Labour Party has called on the Commission to do everything possible to ensurethat prospective voters are not disenfranchised in next year’s polls.National Chairman of the party, Julius Abure, commended the Commission for the progress recorded inthe last few months in addressing some of the technical challenges witnessed during the Anambra Stategovernorship election late last year and the FCT council polls in February, this year.He said: “We need to improve on continuous voters registration because a lot of young people who wantto register have not been able to register in the past two weeks across the country.“You know registration is the Commission’s precedent for people to have their PVCs and then to be ableto participate in the election.“We want to appeal to INEC that they should deploy more officials to the field to continue with theregistration of prospective voters”.Abure who gave a pass mark to the Commission, said, “I have confidence in INEC that they would not beoverwhelmed in terms of their preparation for the 2023 general elections. I know that INEC is prepared forthe election. I know part of the defaults we noticed in the Anambra and FCT elections were corrected. But Iam sure that it’s going to be put to test in the EKiti and Osun elections”.The Independent National Electoral Commission had at different fora cleared all doubts about itsreadiness for the 2023 general elections.Analysts, however, believe that the outcome of next year’s polls would have far-reaching implications forthe country beyond 2023. They have, therefore, appealed that INEC must be at its best this time, warningthat poor results could affect democratic transition in the country.The analysts further submitted that the electoral body must do all it takes to preserve not only its integrity,but also to sustain the existing political stability in the country by conducting a free, fair and credibleelections to the satisfaction of the Nigerian public and the international community.Several stakeholders, including civil society organisations are skeptical about the elections given theirregularities that characterised political parties congresses in most states and challenges connected withthe deployment of technology. In its review of the 2019 general elections, INEC confessed that the deployment of technology in theelectoral process came with challenges. The Commission also disclosed that it recorded over 1,689litigations arising from the 2019 elections.This was not only the challenge, logistic and operational plans also came up as a result of shortage ofvoting materials, especially ballot papers in many states.The National Peace Committee led by General Abdusalami Abubakar, has also expressed fear that theforthcoming 2023 general election could not meet the expectations of Nigerians for a free, transparent andcredible electoral process.In a recent statement signed by the former Head of State, the peace committee said, “judging from theexperience at the recent party primaries, where politicians monetised the entire process, the hope ofordinary Nigerians that their interest and aspirations will be reflected in the outcome of the 2023 generalelection may be lost.“We are aware that the 2023 election may not be the best – as can be attested to by the monetisation ofthe process, the acrimonious conduct of the recent party primaries, and the elevation of the ‘delegateposition’ over and above the welfare of ordinary Nigerians,” the committee said.INEC which had come under public criticisms over failure of the technology the Commission deployedduring last year’s governorship election in Anambra State and the February FCT local government polls,was also criticised when the Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Mamood Yakubu, who was perceived tobe under pressure from the ruling party, extended the deadline for party primary elections in a bid to givethe parties enough time to prepare for the exercises.The decision did not go down well with the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who accusedINEC of altering the goalposts in the middle of the game, emphasising that election certainty is thebackbone of democracy.President Muhammadu Buhari had on 25 February 2022, signed the Electoral Bill into law. The law hasnow toughened the country’s electoral laws, adding to the tension and signalling that it could, for the firsttime in years, have elections that could widely be considered credible.Provisions in the new law give the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) more decision-making powers and set aside early funding for it to avoid embarrassing technical and logistic lags that havecharacterised past elections in the country.The INEC had in February this year disclosed that it has received substantial amount of funds for theelection, this was even before the signing of the electoral law.Similarly, the law also gives legal backing to the use of electronic card readers for voting and electronicmethods for transferring results for collation, to the disappointment of some politicians who had argued thatthe state of the country’s telecommunications network system could hinder voting in some areas.With barely nine months to the general elections, civil society organisations have advised that beyond thenew Electoral Act that gives more power for the country’s electoral umpire, the INEC has the duty to purgeitself off moles in its midst across the country.On its part, Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) has maintained that for the Independent NationalElectoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a free and credible elections in 2023, it must summon the courageto dismantle its current technical department to consolidate on its ongoing reforms.The group also warned that if the advice was not heeded, INEC would continue to harbour moles just asit would continue to experience technical hitches that might cause the Commission serious embarrassmentthat could put its credibility into question.Chairman of the group, Auwal Ibrahim Musa, raised the alarm that despite ongoing reform efforts by theCommission, Nigerians were still skeptical of the credibility of next year’s election due to several allegationsof manipulation of sensitive electoral materials, especially BVAS by staff of the Independent NationalElectoral Commission (INEC) to favour selected political actors during election.Auwal said the very reason why election in Nigeria was a do or die affair, was because “some politiciansand some security agencies as well as some officials in the electoral body have turned election into amoney making business”.He explained that although there have been improvement in the electoral process by the way of reforms,however civil society organisations would continue to support INEC and provide them with credibleinformation on how to improve on the electoral process in the country.According to him: “We have seen that transformation since Attahiru Jega came into INEC and this currentINEC has also consolidated on those achievements.“We will urge the leadership of INEC to carry out a kind of deployment of some people within INECheadquarters because part of the observation that many people have made is that when you have somepeople sitting in a particular department, especially departments that has to do with logistics, they are usedto this arrangement that continue to fail.“So it’s important that INEC leadership redeploy and reorganize sensitive staff who have stayed long andwhose contributions have not helped improve the electoral process. By so doing, the allegations madeagainst these people would have been addressed.“There are allegations that politicians have individual contacts in INEC. If you are able to reorganise the place, do some deployment, bring some staff from the headquarters to other places. I think it would alsoallay the fear that many people are having that one of the reasons why we continue to have logisticschallenges, procurement failure is because some people have entrenched themselves in a particulardepartment or location. So there is need to unbundle that and do redeployment and also have neworientation for the staff there. Also contractors who have been there need to comply with PublicProcurement law.“This is the only explanation on why these machines continuously refuse to work. If there is nomanipulation or deliberate attempt to shortchange the electoral process, why is that we are having issueswith these machines and why is that we have not sufficiently trained the electoral officials to handle thesemachines very well? This why I said the technical department also needs reform.“Deployment is part of the technical issue in INEC, especially dealing with the BVAS which is one of thedepartments INEC must unbundle because there appear to be allegations of manipulation in that process.If we want to have a better election, that department would have to be dismantled. There is no way you willcontinue with the way things are structured there. BVAS would come and they would not be working andpeople complain. So where are the technicians.“I think it’s important we take this very seriously because if we want to really see a better election in 2023,we need to take into consideration all these issues that I have just pointed out otherwise we would continueto have a repeat of these problems without solutions”, Auwal advised.INEC has, however, given an assurance that the commission would perform better in subsequentelections in the country, starting with Ekiti and Osun, noting that it has uncovered the causes of the glitchesexperienced at the Anambra State governorship and FCT local council polls.INEC National Commissioner for Voters Education Committee, Festus Okoye, who gave the assuranceat a recent training workshop for journalists in Abuja, said the commission has been able to uncover whatwent wrong and they have been rectified.Okoye disclosed that the technology was produced locally by INEC engineers, noting that the “back andforth” experienced during both elections was a building process that was expected.“It (Bimodal Voters Authentication System) was a product of INEC engineers in Port Harcourt. It’s atechnology built by human. Even human goes through similar process”.The commission’s recent redistribution of eligible voters to new polling units seems to have discongestedthe over crowded existing polling units in the country.Okoye disclosed that out of the 176, 846 existing polling units, some of the newly created polling unitshave zero voters while others have up to 5000 registered voters that needed to be decongested to ensure aseamless voting process in the future.He said: “In 2021, the Commission created 56,827 additional polling units in Nigeria to 176, 846.Populating the newly created polling units is a huge challenge. The Commission is working hard to balancethese polling units”.INEC has also expressed skepticism on the possibility of the increasing number of internally displacedpersons to vote in the next general elections.Okoye said although the 2023 general election would come with challenges, the Commission wasdetermined to surmount it to conduct free, fair, credible and elusive elections but the growing insecurity insome parts of the country and increasing number of IDPs would pose a biggest challenge to the conduct ofthe 2023 general elections.
