 Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has lamented the inability of the security agencies to rescue Dr. Uwadinachi Iweha, who was kidnapped in Abia state over week now. In a statement signed by its president, Dr. Uche R. Ojinmah, NMA said it had followed keenly for a week the unfolding saga following the kidnap of the Iweha. It urged the security agencies to redouble their effort in securing the release of the doctor from captivity. NMA said the Inspector-General of Police should create a deliberate policy to prevent the kidnap of doctors, other Health care workers and their families as a tool for reduction of the medical brain drain in Nigeria “We have noted the spirited efforts by our Abia State branch to secure his release which has, for now, yielded no fruit. The NMA condemn the kidnap of Dr. Iweha and calls on the government of Abia State and security agencies to redouble their effort in securing the release of our distinguished medical elder. “We call on the kidnappers to search their conscience and see if it is right to keep in forced captivity an elder that has spent most of his life in the service of humanity.”
