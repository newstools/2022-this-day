 Tosin Clegg Leading entertainment outfits, Achievas Entertainment has signed gospel singer, Jacinta Onyinyechi Onuoha better known by the stage name as ‘Onyinye’. Speaking on the choice of a gospel singer, Founder of Achievas Entertainment, Mr. Paul Cole Chiori said Onyinye was signed because of her singing prowess, ability to compose songs and her vocal power. “Onyinye is much more than a singer who has all qualities needed of an artiste to excel in the creative industry, she understands the craft and above all her unique voice and texture will differentiate her from others”, Chiori said. As part of her building-up, while in school, Onyinye worked with a gospel evangelical group as a chorister where she ministered in schools like University of Lagos, University of Benin, Kwara State University, Federal University of Technology Owerri amongst others. It is however pertinent to note that while Onyinye is signed to Achievas Entertainment; she would be managed by the Undaground Media outfit led by Mr. Daniel Cole Chiori. Speaking on working with the gospel singer, Daniel noted that it was the first time Achievas entertainment will be signing a female gospel artiste, “and there is need to harness both the artiste and the brand properly; more reason why the media outfit was saddled with the responsibility of positioning both parties. After listening to some of the unreleased songs of Onyinye, It is true to state that the world isn’t ready for what she has in stock.”
