 An inexperienced Italy began their rebuilding job with an impressive 1-1 home draw with Germany in a Nations League opener for both sides. Having failed to qualify for this year’s World Cup in Qatar, Italy opted to test out numerous raw players. One of them, 18-year-old substitute Wilfried Gnonto, set up Lorenzo Pellegrini for a 70th-minute goal. Germany levelled immediately, with Joshua Kimmich firing in to make it 10 games unbeaten under Hansi Flick. Germany’s next game in Group A3 is a home match against England, who were beaten 1-0 in Hungary earlier on Saturday. Italy host the Hungarians, with both games on 7 June. This international clash between Hungary and England was billed to take place behind closed doors as UEFA punishment for racist and homophobic behaviour by Hungary’s fans during Euro 2020. And yet it was played in front of a large crowd, consisting mainly of schoolchildren allowed in under UEFA rules – and the young supporters revelled in a poor England performance and Dominik Szoboszlai’s winning goal from the penalty spot after Reece James fouled Zsolt Nagy.
