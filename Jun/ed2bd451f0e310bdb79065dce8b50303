However, the financial results showed that the six largest banks – Access, Zenith, First Bank, GTCO, UBA, Ecobank – with respect to deposits, assets, loans and profitability, maintained their industry dominance. For instance, in terms of profitability, the six bank made 85 per cent of the total profits recorded by the 14 banks; in terms of loans, the gave out 76 per cent of the loans to customers; attracted 81 per cent of the customers’ deposits and presently hold 79 per cent of the total assets.

Fintechs have continued to encroach on commercial banks’ businesses, thereby threatening the operations and deposit mobilisation by the banks. The Central Bank of Nigeria’s Monetary Policy Committee recently stated that the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) of the banking industry has remained above their prudential limits at 14.6 and 43.7 per cent, respectively. Also, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of the industry stood at 5.3 per cent in April 2022, compared with its prudential limit of five per cent, reflecting sustained stability in the banking system, though there remains a need to bring this down to the prudential limit.
