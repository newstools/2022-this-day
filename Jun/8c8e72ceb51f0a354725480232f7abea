Creative entrepreneur Obi Asika is set to premiere a documentary series that follows the journey of Nigerian and black music through the years this month. Titled ‘Journey of the Beats’, the 10-part documentary series tells the important story of how this generation of Nigerian artists found their confidence and identity through music and how it enabled the enormous growth of youth culture in Nigeria and then to Africa and the world. It tells a story of a music that has unlocked a global movement from small independent labels and promoters in Lagos to spread globally and produce billions of streams, hits, and fans. Featured in the documentary series are some of Nigeria’s biggest and most legendary artists such as 2Baba, P-Square, Onyeka Onwenu, Daddy Showkey, Flavour, and D’Banj among other notable names. “The show came about from conversations with collaborators over the years and the need to document the journey of our music, to celebrate those who made it happen and share their stories. It’s incredible that people are going to watch this brilliant piece of work as it educates, empowers and enables more people to engage the industry and see the breadth, reach, and power of our music. I am hopeful the impact is wider than the music industry as our music affects fashion, dance, lifestyle, movies, and entertainment as well,” said Asika. Obi has been involved in the growth of Nigeria’s music industry over the years as the founder of an indigenous music label Storm Records that spawned entertainers, such as Naeto C, Ikechukwu, and Yung 6ix among others. The documentary which will premiere exclusively on Showmax is one that the platform is very proud of. “The growth of Afrobeats cannot be overstated and we feel privileged as a platform to showcase and tell the story behind its evolution,” said Showmax Head of Content, Candice Fangueiro. It will be available on the platform on June 23.
