 Lagos State Volleyball Association in conjunction with the Lagos State Sports  Commission have concluded arrangements to organise maiden edition of the “Super-Four” Sitting-Volleyball Championship. The event has been scheduled to take place  between 17 and 18  June, 2022, at the National Stadium Indoor Sports Hall, Surulere, Lagos State. According to the association, the aim is to promote the sport just like the other sports and to also build a formidable team that would represent the state at both national and International tournaments. It is a competition staged for the top three  teams of the just concluded National Para Sports that was recently held in Abuja this year, with Lagos State Sitting Volleyball team to make the total number to be four as the host state. Chairman, Legacy Volleyball Club, who is also a board member in Lagos State Volleyball Association, Mr.Kayode Ladele, said the essence of the tournament is to encourage sporting activities among Nigeria’s physically challenged population. Last month, he donated sporting equipment to Lagos State Sitting-volleyball players during an exhibition game to select players that will represent the state in the competitions. “Sitting Volleyball is not a new game but just finding its feet in Nigeria, the sport has been in existence for a long time. Sitting Volleyball requires almost the same techniques as the normal volleyball except that the game is played by the physically challenged person’s,” Ladele stated.
