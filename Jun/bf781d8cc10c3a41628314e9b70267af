 James Sowole in Abeokuta A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State, Prince Adekunle Ayoola, has commended  the former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, for his post-party’s primary consultation and visits to his co-contestants  in the election. He said Tinubu has displayed his magnanimity over his landslide victory recorded at the last week’s presidential primary of the party. Tinubu won the APC presidential primary last week after defeating six other aspirants, including the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. In a statement made available to journalists in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Ayoola, while congratulating Tinubu for the deserving victory, however, urged him to remain a leader with large heart and never count it against anyone who contested the presidential ticket with him especially from the Southwest. Ayoola said the unity and progress of the South-west region and even that of the entire country which Tinubu has always fought for remain paramount consideration. He urged the presidential candidate to close ranks with those who struggled the presidential ticket with him in the spirit of moving the country forward. Ayoola, a political scientist, said: “The work ahead is much such that we need everyone to be on board, and luckily for us, God has given us a visionary leader and democrat par excellence, Tinubu, who will definitely use his wealth of experience to expand the frontiers of prosperity and socio-economic development of our great country. “Part of the great assignment ahead of Tinubu presidency is to tackle headlong the problem of insecurity, restructuring, granting of local government autonomy, diversification of economy, provision of jobs for our teeming youths. The work ahead is much; it requires the support and cooperation of all, and that is why Asiwaju’s peace moves and reconciliatory efforts should begin now.”
