Igbawase Ukumba in LafiaThe Nasarawa State government has launched a pitch competition to strengthen the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sub-sector of the state. Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the Nasarawa State Investment Development Agency (NASIDA), Mr. Ibrahim Abdullahi, disclosed this last week when presenting cheques to three winners of the competition in Lafia, reiterating the state’s commitment to that effect. The Managing Director of the state investment agency consequently presented cheques worth $10,000 to the three winners of its MSMEs Challenge Competition. Speaking shortly after presenting the cheques to the winners, Abdullahi noted that apart from the $10,000 prize monies, the agency would provide non-financial support centering on advisory, training and networking which are core to the growth of small businesses. He said: “The MSMEs Challenge organised by the agency is a pilot project that the state hopes to use to encourage the formation of new enterprises and to urge existing ones extend their service offerings in keeping with its economic develpment plan. “The state government hopes to replicate this project. This is one way we feel we can effectively reach out to businesses that impacted on the economy of the state.”
