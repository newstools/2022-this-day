Surely, Kofoworola Adebutu, the pretty wife of billionaire and Chairman of Premier Lotto, Sir Kessington Adebukola Adebutu, is one of those women who want people to put some respect on their names. Though a notable member of the privileged class of Nigerian billionaires’ wives, Kofoworola cannot be tagged with the sweeping brush of the “Trophy Wife” title. This is because she is strong-willed. Besides, her quest for independence and living her passion has led her to set up a store, Koftop Luxury, a top shop that offers distinctive luxury merchandise, including high-end fabrics and shoes. She is undoubtedly becoming a force in her own right. She is also on the path to establishing herself as a solid business personality, following the opening of her mega mall on Fola Osibo Street, Lekki Phase1, Lagos, last week. The imposing mall named ‘DualFol’ after her twins’ sons, Folarin and Folami, was declared open by the Ogun State First Lady, Mrs. Bamidele Abiodun. Of course, 45-year-old Kofoworola, a 2001 Accountancy graduate of Olabisi Onabanjo University, had her husband, Odole Oodua Adebutu, throw his weight behind her. She also had most of her stepsons led by Ladi Adebutu around to rally support as well as many of her friends, including Folashade Okoya, Erelu Tola Osifeso, Alhaja Kuburat Shitta-Bey and Mrs Jokotade Adeusi.
