Azuka Ogujiuba Future Face Africa, the continent’s largest model search competition is set for its grand finale in Lagos. After a rigorous selection process involving physical castings in eight countries, as well as thousands of digital applications from all over the world, the Future Face Africa judges have selected 18 finalists who have been flown into Lagos for a chance to turn their modelling aspirations into a reality. The event will take place on January 30 at Eko Hotel & Suites, where models will be competing for a chance to win a two-year contract with a top international modelling agency, as well as a $5,000 USD cash prize. The FFA project is spearheaded by Elizabeth Isiorho, a pioneer in the African modelling industry and the founder of Beth Model Management Africa, Africa’s largest modelling agency. Over the past 17 years, Beth Model has served as an industry pacesetter, helping to launch the careers of dozens of internationally-placed models, and has cultivated some of the best talents in the industry, such as Mayowa Nicholas and Davidson Obennebo. Isiorho previously organised Elite Model Look Nigeria, but after a two-year hiatus, re-emerged with Future Face Africa to expand her model search beyond the borders of Nigeria alone, and offer a wider range of hopefuls a chance at success. Isiorho said: “FFA will be giving opportunities to people from various countries, backgrounds and skin tones, aiming to go beyond the buzzwords of “diversity” and “inclusivity” to create an initiative that truly celebrates the range of beauty that the industry has to offer. “FFA will be equipping selected models with the knowledge and skills to achieve international success and to have long-lasting careers in a very competitive industry. For these models, Future Face Africa will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that could change their lives forever.” FFA is proudly sponsored by: Aquafina, Ecobank, Mac, Haute Couture and Nature’s Gentle touch.
