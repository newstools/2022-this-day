Gideon Arinze in Enugu The Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) has stated its readiness to embark on an intensive revenue drive across its franchise area. The exercise, which will effectively commence on January 25, is expected to last till January 29, 2022. EEDC’s Head of Corporate Communications, Mr. Emeka Ezeh, who made this known in a statement yesterday, said the revenue drive was to enable the company cover up for the lost days experienced in the month of January occasioned by the imposed sit-at-home order and insecurity situation in the Southeast. He explained that the exercise would entail visits by officials of the company to its customers for payment of their energy bills, as well as disconnection of those that are indebted. “This move became necessary to enable EEDC effectively sustain its operations and provide quality services to its customers. In addition, it will enable the company to pay for energy it imported and meet up with its obligations to the market operators and other stakeholders,” Ezeh said. He appealed to customers of the EEDC to cooperate with the officials that would visit their premises during the period of the drive. According to him, “It is pertinent to note that the power sector cannot effectively operate if energy bills are not paid by customers.” He maintained that to avoid being disconnected, customers are advised to visit the EEDC cash offices nearest to them or any of the collection agents within their locality to pay their bills. “Payments can also be made through the various online channels, including EEDC Connect, Energy Pay (via EEDC website: www.enugudisco.com),” he said.
