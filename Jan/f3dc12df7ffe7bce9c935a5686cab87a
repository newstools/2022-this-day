“In the last one month, for only two weeks, the ban on unregistered vehicles and vehicles without permit and the abuse on the provision of the restriction on the use of motor cycles(okada) in the night brought to a standstill 80 per cent criminal activities in Ondo State.
” Initially, people were not too happy until they realised that it was for their good. Again, within the first 15 days of manning all major junctions and entry points of the state capital and all local government headquarters, we were able to arrest over 550 vehicles. We were able to arrest over 600 suspects.
“Out of this number screened and brought about 45 of them to book and charged them to court. We found out that the criminal activities in the main towns went down completely and people travelling started having problems. That was why we moved to the border patrols and you will recall that within 48 hours of commencement of border patrol, we were confronted by kidnappers and armed robbers. Seventeen victims were rescued in two separate operations,” he said.
