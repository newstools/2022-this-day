Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo Former governor of Osun State and first interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, last Thursday evening gifted Governor Adegboyega Oyetola a horse which he said, he should ride to power.
Governor Oyetola had after his strategic engagement tour of Ila Federal Constituency, visited Akande at his residence in Ila. The tour is a statewide consultation to the nine Federal Constituencies in Osun which the governor is using to fraternise with the newly elected APC executives at the wards and local government levels and to inform them and party members of his intention to participate in the party’s forthcoming primaries in preparation for the July governorship election. The presentation of the horse to the governor by “Baba Omo Ke ke ke” as Chief Akande is fondly called, is highly symbolic and seen as a declaration of an unalloyed support for the person and candidature of Oyetola. Horse, political pundits say, symbolises strength, power, freedom, triumph, heroism, nobleness, stamina, tireless, confidence and intelligence. In fact, they say it is a precious gift of life and highly celebrated animal. Although, it is used for different purposes, what is constant, according to political pundits is that it is used as a ride to celebrate good things. While accepting the gift, Oyetola who was obviously surprised and excited with smiles on his face said “thank you very much.”
