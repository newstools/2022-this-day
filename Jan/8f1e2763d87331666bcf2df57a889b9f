Egypt defeated Ivory Coast 5-4 on penalties yesterday to reach the quarter-finals at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon following a 0-0 draw at regulation and extra time. The North Africans got the upper hand in the shoot-out when substitute keeper Gabaski saved Eric Bailly’s effort in the third round of spot-kicks. And Pharaohs captain Mohamed Salah netted the decisive penalty to send the record seven-time champions through. Egypt will face Morocco in the last eight in Yaounde on Sunday evening (5pm). The finale was somewhat harsh on Manchester United defender Bailly, who had performed superbly at the back while sporting a rugby scrum cap on his return from a head injury. Yet he took a short run-up for his penalty and placed his effort too close to Gabaski, who dived to his right and stuck out his left hand to push the ball onto the bar. The Zamalek keeper had come on right at the end of the second half after Mohamed El Shenawy picked up a leg injury, and may well start against Morocco depending on the extend of the injury suffered by Egypt’s number one.
