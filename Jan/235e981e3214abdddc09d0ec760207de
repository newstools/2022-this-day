Segun Awofadeji in Gombe As Gombe State joined the rest of the world to mark this year’s International Day of Education, the Gombe State Governor, Mr. Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, has restated his desire to see Gombe State at the forefront in terms of high quality education in Nigeria. The governor, in a message yesterday to commemorate the International Day of Education 2022, which is celebrated every year on January 24, said that his government would not relent until the goal of repositioning the education sector for effective and efficient service delivery is achieved. While commending the theme of this year’s celebration, “Changing Course, Transforming Education,” Governor Inuwa noted that with measures put in place, his administration has indeed succeeded in changing the negative narrative hitherto associated with the state, especially the basic education in Gombe State. He particularly expressed happiness with gradual upscale in performance of the students of Gombe State in external examinations, saying with the state of emergency declared by his administration, a lot has been achieved, especially in basic education sector, through putting up classrooms, laboratories, libraries and provision of necessary infrastructure needed for good and sound quality education. “The declaration of a state of emergency in education in Gombe State by our administration saw a sudden departure from the prism of a narrow window dressing to a broad and holistic approach towards addressing the numerous challenges confronting the sector, especially at the basic level, which is the most critical stage in human development. “Today, the situation in the education sector, particularly at the basic level, is gradually and steadily changing for the better and to the benefit of the younger generation. Aside from the massive construction, renovation and remodeling of schools and staff quarters, we have also established a state-of-the-art Teachers Resource Centre (TRC) in Kwami, the first of its kind in the North-East sub-region, for the training and retraining of teachers.” Describing education as the cradle upon which development indices are measured, the governor assured that his administration would continue to take measures that would address all gaps and challenges bedeviling the sector. This year’s International Day of Education, which marked the fourth since it was proclaimed in 2018 by United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), highlighted the need for a new way forward in transforming the education sector
