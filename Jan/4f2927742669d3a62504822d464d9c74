Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City The management of Ossiomo Power in Benin City said it has commissioned a 40MW Independent Power Plant (IPP) dedicated to providing power to the Benin Industrial and Enterprise Park and local communities in Ologbo, Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State. Managing Director, Ossiomo Power, Dr. Uwa Igiehon, who stated this in Benin City, capital of the state, noted that in conjunction with the Edo State Government, the power plant would provide 24/7 power to Ologbo and Obayantor communities in the area. He said the development was a testament to Governor Godwin Obaseki’s pledge to light up Edo State. The Benin Enterprise Park (BEP) is a 997-hectare, mixed-use, development designed to accommodate light industries and residential zones. The BEP would be equipped with a state-of-the-art civil infrastructure comprising graded plots, roads, power, water, communications, drainage, sewage treatment plant, effluent treatment plant, stormwater drains, rainwater harvesting, and firefighting facilities, among others. It would also include specialised infrastructure, such as quality control labs, quality certification centres, raw material storage, and other warehousing and logistics services. According to Igiehon, “The 40MW plant was tested on 29th of December and is fully operational. At the moment, the plant is providing electricity to Ologbo and Obayantor communities in the area.” It would be recalled that Ologbo community had been severed from the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) for the past four years, which had thrown the community into darkness. Igiehon said the initiative had brought succour to members of Ologbo community who now benefit from the power supply from the new power plant.
