Jelani Aliyu is a creative and innovative United States-based world renowned automotive designer. Presently, he is the Director General of National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), a parastatal under Ministry of Trade and Investment. His mission is direct and unambiguous: to reposition Nigeria as one of the leading automotive manufacturing countries in the world. As one of the world’s best car designers, Aliyu has helped in transforming General Motors after working there for three years. It is worthy to recall the period when three advanced studios in California, United States, Michigan, United States, and in United Kingdom were engaged in competition. There were hundreds of entries, out of which five were chosen for the final round. At the final selection, Aliyu’s proposal was voted as the best, thereafter enabling him to conceptualize the design to attain advanced level with a target to capture the African environment. Without a doubt, Aliyu is a world acclaimed automotive industry specialist. As the DG of NADDC, he has remained focused like a lion poised to attack and like an eagle flying with vision. It is especially with this remarkable vision that he designed the General Motor’s leading auto brand, Chevrolet Voit. With this resounding success in the automotive industry, it is unanimously agreed that Aliyu’s record would be difficult for his successor to surpass. Little wonder, he recently got reappointed as the NADDC director general to continue to create new grounds for the council. However, many are of the view that Aliyu would be the right man to succeed the current Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, in 2023 if he declares his interest in the near future. Indeed, Sokoto State would be the better for Aliyu’s world-acclaimed feats in creativity and industry. Anjorin Adeolu Joseph, anjorin.adeolu@yahoo.com
