John Shiklam President Muhammadu Buhari arrived in Kaduna yesterday for a two-day working visit. Spokesman to Governor Nasir El-Rufai, Muyiwa Adekeye, had earlier disclosed in a statement yesterday in Kaduna that the president would arrive today. Adekeye said, during the visit, the president, “will commission several important projects during the two-day visit from today to tomorrow.” According to the statement, Buhari would also visit the three major towns of Kaduna, Zaria and Kafanchan, and would also be shown round road projects across the state, executed by the El-Rufai administration. Adekeye said the projects to be commissioned by the president include the remodeled Murtala Muhammed Square, which is located in Kaduna city, the Infectious Disease Hospital, located at Mando, the Dangote Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited along Kaduna-Abuja expressway, and the Sabon Gari market in Zaria. The statement further stated that Buhari would also commission the reconstructed Kawo flyover which has three grand rotaries and access roads, the dualised WAFF Road as well as road projects in Kafanchan and Zaria. It pointed out that already the state government was putting finishing touches to preparations to receive the president. Major streets and roundabouts in some strategic locations have been cleaned or renovated in anticipation of the President’s visit. Security agencies are also said to be mobilising their personnel to ensure a hitch free visit by the President. Kaduna is one of the northwest states facing serious security challenges. Almost on a daily basis, people are being killed or abducted by dare devil bandits in their homes and on the highways.
