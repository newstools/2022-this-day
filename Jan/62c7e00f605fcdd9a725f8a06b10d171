Vanessa Obioha In his authorial debut, ‘The Gift in The Odds: Walking Through Walls’, Nollywood actor Jim Iyke reveals a side of him that is rarely glimpsed in public. The 15 part-series plumbs the different perceptions of him while presenting an uncut ‘Jim’ as he puts it. “Up till now, I have left the telling of my story to the media and kept the unabridged ‘Jim’ under wraps,” he writes. “I have courted controversy and refused to apologize for my often polemical stance. I have amused myself with the hasty judgements of the court of public opinion and refused to commit to the many invitations to shed the mercurial and enigmatic public persona and reveal the real me in all my audacious and instinctual glory. However, with these e-book series, I reveal all because the time for it has come.” Set for launch on Tuesday, February 1, Iyke was inspired to write this book while he was secluded in France with his son during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Besides revealing the unconventional ways he approaches life, the book delves into topics like grief, marriage and friendship. With over a decade and a half in the Nollywood industry, Iyke’s book is coming on the heels of his latest movie ‘Bad Comments’ which he produced. The book marks his foray into the publishing world and will be available on select online platforms.
