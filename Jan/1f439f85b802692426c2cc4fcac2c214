Segun Awofadeji in Gombe A woman, one Lawiza Muazu of Unguwa Uku area of Gombe State, has sued her husband, one Mr. Muazu, before a criminal area court at Unguwar Idi for allegedly biting her while they were quarreling. Presenting her complaint to the court yesterday, Lawiza alleged that the husband also beats her regularly when they have misunderstanding. The woman added that the latest quarrel she had with the man was when she refused to cook food for the house claiming that her action was as a result of non-provision of firewood or charcoal by him. She said: “When he beat me for the first time, I went home but my father asked me to go back. But my husband later resorted to biting me after the beating (sic). He would bite my fingers for refusing to cook food.” She, therefore, asked the court to dissolve her marriage with Muazu because she could no longer tolerate him. Responding to the allegations, the husband, Muazu, denied biting and beating Lawiza. He said she refused to cook for one week, which contravened the gentleman agreement that his two wives would serve food to the house on their cooking days. He said that it was as a result of that the co-wife, Jummai, refused to give Lawiza the food she cooked. “In protest of not being served by her co-wife, Lawiza got hold of me demanding for her right. She put her hands in my pocket trying to remove money by force. It was as a result of it that quarrel ensued between us but I never bit her,” he said. The Presiding Judge, Garba Abubakar, adjourned hearing to Monday next week to enable the wife present her witnesses.
