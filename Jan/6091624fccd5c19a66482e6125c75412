Hammed Shittu in Ilorin The Kwara State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, (NSCDC) has arrested four Fulani ‘bororo’ suspected to be members of the armed robbery gang along Isanlu Isin-/Ijara Road in Isin Local Government Area of the state. The suspects, according to the NSCDC, were those terrorising and attacking passengers along the area in the past few weeks. In a statement issued yesterday by the Public Relations Officer of the NSCDC, Mr. Zaid Afolabi, added that the four suspects were caught while attempting to escape from the robbery scene. Afolabi said: “The civil defence in conjunction with the local vigilante group, responded swiftly to a distress call in the early hours of Monday, around 03.00 a.m. as armed robbers in their large number ambushed motorists and passengers travelling inside a Toyota Sienna space car along Isanlu Isin- Ijara Isin road and dispossessed them of their valuables. “The robbers have actually disappeared into the nearby bush by the time when we arrived the scene of the robbery incident but with the help of the vigilante group and the local hunters we were able to comb the nearby bush and rounded up four Fulani/ Bororos men suspected to be members of the robbery gang. “The security agencies commenced the manhunt in order to arrest other members of the gang.” He, however, used the opportunity to advised people to avoid night travelling as most criminal activities took place during the night hours. Afolabi also called on the residents of the state to report any unusual movement or activities noticed in their neighborhood to the security agencies.
