Chinedu Eze The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has yielded to the clamour of air travellers for the expansion of the terminal facilities at the airports, especially the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos, and has announced that it would expand the facilities at the General Aviation Terminal, known as MMA1. The agency said it would expand the Zulu Wing of the terminal to enhance passenger facilitation. The agency said the expansion project, which would commence any moment from now, would only hamper passenger facilitation minimally at the terminal, as normal passenger check-in would not be affected in any way. “However, the Protocol and VIP lounge at the terminal will be affected, as the facilities will be relocated temporarily till the end of the project, since major construction works will be carried out in that axis of the terminal,” FAAN said in a statement signed by the General Manager, Public Affairs, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu. Meanwhile, the Authority is already making arrangements for temporary spaces to be used as Protocol and VIP lounges, while the project is being executed. “When the expansion project is completed, the terminal would have been enhanced in terms of capacity, aesthetics and passenger comfort, as the expected and expanded new lounges will be twice what is presently on ground. “The Authority will like to appeal to passengers and other airport users to please be patient and bear with us for any inconvenience, while the project will last,” FAAN said. Passengers’ surge last December witnessed the stretching of facilities at the terminal; that it caused flight delays and the carousel was overworked and it broke down severally. Reports indicated that the agency recorded the highest passenger traffic from the terminal last month and exposed the obsolete facilities and lack of capacity, hence the planned expansion.
