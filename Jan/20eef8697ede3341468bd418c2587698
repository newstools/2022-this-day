Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Katsina State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) could not boast of a N3 billion project within the Katsina city. The Chairman of the PDP, Mr. Salisu Yusuf Majigiri, while addressing journalists at the party’s secretariat in Katsina Sunday, challenged the APC to invite President Muhammadu Buhari to inaugurate a project in the ancient city that is worth N3 billion. He said: “In terms of welfare, what can you say about the APC-led government of Masari? They cannot boast of a N3 billion project in the capital city of Katsina.
“If there is any project ready for commissioning in Katsina city as the capital city and the seat of power, let the government invite the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to come and commission that project so that people can see and testify.”
On the issue of local government elections, he said, it was not within the responsibility of Governor Aminu Bello Masari to announce the time for the conduct of the council election in the state.
He said: “If the governor is allowed to determine and guide the issue of local government’s election by announcing the time, he may end up announcing the winners and that will be a big problem.”
He, however, announced the readiness of the PDP to participate in the council polls, saying the party would reclaim power in 2023 and secure citizens from what he termed bad leadership and security challenges.
