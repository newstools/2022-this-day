We will try to achieve our ambitions. We prepared well and now we are ready for the competition. Our opponents are not easy team. But we have the strength and determination to make a good start,” enthused the 60-year-old Portuguese gaffer.

Their top marksman, Bertrand Traoré, pledged to make this edition a memorable one for his folks back home. “We have a good team. For me, it is a pleasure to be here and I have the intention of playing at my best level and bringing what’s most expected of me.”
