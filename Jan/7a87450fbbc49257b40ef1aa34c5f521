Fidelis David in Akure Ondo state government has vowed to sanction secondary school principals found of extorting parents and guardians under the guise of payment of unauthorised fees. In a statement made available to Journalists yesterday, the Commissioner for Education Science and Technology in the State, Mr. Olufemi Agagu, said it has come to the knowledge of the state government that some secondary school principals have allegedly devised ingenious means of extorting parents and guardians under extraneous covers, for the payment of unauthorised fees. Agagu said this is in spite of state governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s approval of the sum of N515 million for the payment of the 2022 West Africa Secondary School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) registration fees for SS3 students in all public secondary schools in the State. The statement reads: “It must be reiterated for the benefit of all that the total approved collectibles for public secondary schools is N4,450 for returning students and N5,800 for new students. For final year students, additional payment of N2,800 has also been approved as administrative and practicals charges. Any other payment demanded from parents and guardians are illegal and unauthorised. “This development is a clear act of sabotage that is highly reprehensible. All such reported cases shall be thoroughly investigated and culprits appropriately sanctioned. “Government , therefore, enjoins all stakeholders to be vigilant and report any of such confirmed extortion to the Ministry of Education Science and Technology”.
