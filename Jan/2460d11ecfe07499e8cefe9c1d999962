Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City The family of the late Capt. Idahosa Wells Okunbo has instituted a scholarship scheme in honour of their departed patriarch. It said 100 Edo public school children would benefit from the initial offer. The eldest child and wife of Olu of Warri, Olori Atuwatse III, disclosed this when she led her siblings to the mausoleum of the late billionaire to offer prayers to mark his posthumous 64th birthday. Explaining the rationale, Olori Atuwatse explained that their father’s passion for education informed the scholarship. “We are going to pay school fees for 100 Indigent children in the memory of our father because he was very passionate about education, and he often said what he owes us, more important, is education,” she explained. “We are targeting primary and secondary school children in public schools in the State whose parents are unable to pay their fees for the year.” She further stated that from “all we have heard since he passed on, it is evident that our father lived an impactful life and left great legacies, and that is what we the children are doing to keep his memory alive.”
