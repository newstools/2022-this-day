James Sowole in Abeokuta The Ogun State Police Command has denied that it is compiling the list of suspected internet fraudsters popularly known as Yahoo boys, which is circulating on social media and alleged to have emanated from the state Police Command. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, dissociated the command from the purported list in a statement issued yesterday. Oyeyemi said the Police Command would have ignored the said list, but for the fact that some extortionists may use it as an opportunity to turn those on the list to easy prey. He said the Police Command, therefore, saw the need to alert the public that the list did not emanate from the Command. According to him, “To start with, the state Police Command has no Assistant Commissioner of Police with the name Yahaya Wakilu, who signed the said list. “It is also worthy of note that no Assistant Commissioner of Police serving under a Deputy Commissioner of Police would use a red pen to sign any document. “Also, the phone number on the fake police letterhead paper used to compile the list is that of a retired Commissioner of Police, who was the former DC of Operations in the Command. “The Command hereby appeals to members of the public to disregard the said list as the Command has nothing to do with it-it is nothing but a fake news.” Oyeyemi said the command would continue to work with other relevant agencies to wage war against crimes in order to make the state a better place to live for all.
