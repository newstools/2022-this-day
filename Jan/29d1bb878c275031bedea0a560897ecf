Mali and Tunisia’s Africa Cup of Nations game ended in chaos after the referee first signalled for full-time on 85 minutes, then ended the game when the clock showed 89 minutes and 47 seconds. Tunisia coach Mondher Kebaier and his technical staff raced on to the field to confront referee Janny Sikazwe after his final whistle consigned them to a 1-0 defeat in Group F. Twenty minutes later, after Mali manager Mohamed Magassouba’s post-match press conference had started, tournament organisers ordered the game to be played to a conclusion. However, in more farcical scenes, Tunisia’s players did not return to the field and Mali were declared winners. Kebaier called the referee’s actions “inexplicable”, adding: “He blew for full time and asked us to go to the dressing room, so the players were in their ice baths and then he asked us to come back out. “In 30 years in this business, I have never seen anything like it,” observed the Tunisian manager. At the end of an action-packed second half, which saw two stoppages for video assistant referee checks as well as a drinks break and several substitutions, Sikazwe became the centre of attention. The Zambian – who refereed two group-stage games at the 2018 World Cup in Russia – had appeared to blow his full-time whistle with five minutes remaining, before checking his timings and continuing the game. Then he signalled the end of the match in the 90th minute – without adding on any additional time for stoppages. Kebaier and his staff angrily confronted Sikazwe and his assistants on the pitch, pointing to their watches and remonstrating about the lack of added time. The officials were given an escort off the pitch by stadium security as the Malians celebrated in front of their fans, but the controversy did not end there. More than 20 minutes later, the Malian side ventured back on to the field for the game to restart, but were awarded the victory after the North Africans failed to emerge.
