By Nseobong Okon-Ekong Transportation Minister, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi will boldly register his political presence in Northern Nigeria when he is conferred with the all-important title of Dan Amanar Daura (Trusted Son of Daura) on February 5. Amaechi, who was a two-time Director General of President Muhammadu Buhari’s presidential campaign is believed to be highly favoured to win the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary. With his given names which allude to Yoruba and Igbo ancestry, the Transportation Minister is being positioned as an all-Nigerian man who can unite the country. The import of the title coming from the natural ruler of Daura, Alhaji Umar Farouk Umar, is not lost on observers of the polity. Daura is Buhari’s homestead. The Dan Amanar Daura title will further deepen Amaechi’s affiliation to the North which is being harshly criticised by interest groups in Southern Nigeria, that condemn the Transportation Minister for being a willing tool in the plan of the North to dominate the rest of Nigeria. Particularly he is faulted for taking the Transport University to Daura and linking strategic northern cities by rail. It is a strongly held believe in some quarters that Buhari had Amaechi in mind when he said on national television that his preferred presidential candidate may be killed if he disclosed his name.
