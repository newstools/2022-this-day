We have a multi-distribution networks. Now we have our own private facility that is able to fulfil a large number of orders across the nation. We are majorly in Lagos. But we have people who distribute outside Lagos, Ilesha, and other places. Due to our production capacity when we started, we could not fulfil the orders we receiving. But presently, we are in some stores in Lagos such as Adiba in Lekki, Surulere and Yaba. We recently onboarded some stores. This is not a self-effort; because of what we want to achieve we cannot do it ourselves. We started the business ourselves and got a number of people that invested in the business.”
