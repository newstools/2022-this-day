The Executive Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, is expected to tee off the maiden Armed Forces Pro-Am Golf Tournament in Jaji, the home of the armed forces infantry. The event which would run between February 1 and 6 would be the first professional golf tournament the Ola Saad Ibrahim Golf Club situated inside the massive complex of the Armed Forces Staff College would be hosting in its five decades in existence. The Captain of the Club, Navy Commander JO Shaibu, disclosed that Governor El Rufai was specially chosen to perform the ceremonial ‘tee-off’ of the great event because of his extra ordinary synergy effort with the armed forces in ensuring that Kaduna is free from banditry and kidnapping. The grand event would see in play by 150 golf professionals and 350 amateurs from across Nigeria. “The Governor has done a lot to ensure that Kaduna is enjoying peace once again”, Shaibu who is equally the Commandant of the Secondary School inside the Staff College noted. “The Governor is always reaching out to the armed forces to ensure that safety prevails in Kaduna State. And the fact that peace has returned is reason over 500 golfers would converge on Jaji for a week-long golfing activity”. The Patron and in fact one of the moving spirits behind the Jaji club, Major General MG Ali, is equally elated that the Ola Saad Golf Club would be welcoming professional golfers for the first time in about 50 years in existence. The General who is also the Commandant of the Nigeria Army School of Infantry reasoned that this was a dream come true. “I love the game of golf with passion”, General Ali confessed. “We have a great golf course in Jaji here and we have been hosting quality amateur tournaments over the years. So when the Captain came with the idea that we should host Pro event for the first time, I supported him fully. I can only assure that we shall collectively strive to make this an annual event”.
