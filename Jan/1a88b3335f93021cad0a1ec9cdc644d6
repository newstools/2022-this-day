Francis Sardauna in Katsina The wife of Katsina State Governor, Dr. Zakiyya Aminu Masari, Tuesday, donated the sum of N10,000 each to 100 orphans, widows and the less privileged in Dutsi Local Government Area of the state. Distributing the funds to the beneficiaries in Dutsi, Mrs Masari said the humanitarian gesture was done through her pet project, Women, Youths and Children Improvement Support Initiative. She reiterated that the gesture was aimed at transforming and alleviating the plight of the orphans, widows and other vulnerable women especially the physically challenged. She expressed optimism that the cash would go a long way in assisting the beneficiaries in boosting their petty trading activities and funding their means of livelihood. The governor’s wife called on residents to be on high alert for persons with symptoms of COVID-19, in view of the proximity of the state to the neighbouring Niger Republic. According to her, “One hundred orphans, widows and the less privileged benefited from this intervention. It is my hope to transform and enhance the society through empowerment and touching the lives of the most vulnerable class to be role models. “I sincerely hope that this class will one day serve as role models by making positive impact and meaningful contributions to societal development.”
