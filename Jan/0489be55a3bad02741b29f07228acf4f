Gabon captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has tested positive for Covid-19 just four days before his country’s first game at the Africa Cup of Nations. Aubameyang and Nice midfielder Mario Lemina returned positive lateral flow tests on arrival at Yaounde’s airport in Cameroon. Coach Anicet Yala also tested positive. Head coach Patrice Neveu told reporters that the trio, who are all asymptomatic, are isolating in their hotel rooms and awaiting results of PCR tests. Gabon play their opening Group C match against Comoros on Monday, with their second group game against Ghana on Friday, 14 January. Arsenal striker Aubameyang, 32, was dropped by the Gunners and stripped of the club’s captaincy last month for disciplinary reasons. Hosts Cameroon will play in the first game of the Nations Cup against Burkina Faso on Sunday at 16:00 GMT.
