The founder of Oando Foundation, Mr. Wale Tinubu, has revealed that over two million people have benefitted from the foundation. Tinubu, who is very proud of the foundation’s achievements in the past 11 years, showed his excitement when he wrote on his twitter handle last Tuesday, “The role of education for peace and development cannot be overemphasised. Without inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong opportunities for all, countries cannot break cycles of poverty and inequality. “I am constantly inspired by Oando Foundation’s 11-year journey. We set out to bridge the education gap in Nigeria with infrastructure development, scholarships, and teacher capacity building. So far, we’ve impacted the lives of 2m Nigerians. “As we commemorate #EducationDay, I look forward to both public and private sector players collectively reimagining the future and committing to the transformation of education to build more sustainable, inclusive, and peaceful futures.” The foundation, over the years has conducted four career talks, schools rehabilitation across Nigeria, while it has also donated educational aids and it also awarded and sponsored scholarships across the nation. Through its scholarship programme, it has impacted thousands of students from poor socio-economic background, while beneficiaries have recorded remarkable strides, performing above 70 per cent average consistently; others have represented their states and local governments in different academic competitions. Since its establishment in 2011, the foundation has dedicated their time, talents and resources in putting smiles on the faces of Nigerian school pupils, teachers and indeed the larger community.
