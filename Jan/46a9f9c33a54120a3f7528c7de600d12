Michael Olugbode The African Union (AU) has suspended Burkina Faso’s membership from the union following last week’s coup deta’t that ousted the democratically elected President Roch Marc Christian Kabore. The AU said the suspension of the West Africa country would be effective until constitutional order is restored in the country. “Council decides in line with the relevant AU instruments to suspend the participation of Burkina Faso in all AU activities until the effective restoration of constitutional order in the country,” AU said in a tweet on Monday. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) had earlier suspended Burkina Faso and demanded the immediate release of President Kabore who was ousted and detained by the military junta. There are indications that a delegation from ECOWAS and an envoy of the United Nations (UN) are due to visit the country to meet with the military leaders before coming out with more actions. Several countries and international bodies have since the military takeover condemned the action, fearing that it could further destabilise a country that have being traumatized by Islamist violence. It is yet to be seen how the leader of the military junta, Paul-Henri Damiba, would accede to pressure to hand back government, since he had already said the country would return to constitutional order “when the conditions are right”. He used the excuse of the inability of the ousted democratic government to arrest the threat of the terrorist group to seize power. Mali and Guinea, after military takeovers in 2021, were also suspended by the AU. The latest coup in Burkina Faso takes the toll to four in the West African region in 18 months.
