OG Tega’s journey into content creation and film came nine years ago when he was in school in Ukriane studying medicine. He and his friends called the House of Craze team made use of their time in Ukraine while under some kind of insurgency and many people flew out of the counyry but they decided to stay – also just to maximise the use of the Instagram platform to showcase their jokes and talents. As his craft progressed in the comic acting industry, he created the popular comedy character called Professor Lawal for his series on Instagram. The motivated for this character came through his experiences when he visited Nigeria and started listening to what people said about their time in school and the things he observed from a teacher-friend that visited.
