Nume Ekeghe Standard Chartered Bank Nigeria has stated that the plan closure of some of its branches will not prompt downsizing in the bank this year. The bank further noted that the reduction in branches was an exercise it embarked few years back in a bid to tilt more towards digitisation and the rising demands of their customer base. The Head, Corporate Affairs, Brand and Marketing, Ms. Dayo Aderugbo in a statement stated: “The branch closures are part of the digitization journey we embarked a few years ago towards optimizing our processes, operating channels, products and service solutions to suit the demands of our clients. “Our digital banking proposition is designed to enhance the experience of our customers who are progressively exploring and demanding simpler, faster, efficient, and more convenient ways of banking at the touch of a button from the convenience of the mobile devices.” Aderugbo added that the closures are also driven in response to changes in customer transaction behaviour. “We have also witnessed a significant adoption of our digital banking services by customers as most of them continue to prioritize convenient banking over the need to visit any of our physical locations to access our products and services.” “The Bank prides itself in a forward-looking People Strategy where we proactively plan our workforce needs to fulfill our Business Strategy. We have continued to retrain and redeploy staff who are impacted by the closure of the Branches in Lagos and Abuja. This closure will not impact any staff in 2022.”
