Inflation will remain structurally high at an average of 13.3%, with an increase in Q1 and Q2.” He however noted that the economic outlook for the country was not gloomy, despite its continued dependence on oil. “The World Bank projects economic growth of 2.5 per cent for Nigeria, with a 3.4 per cent annualised growth rate, driven by the ICT, Financial Services, Manufacturing, Trade and Construction sectors.

I am sure that like me, many of you would like to have a crystal ball to give you a sneak peek into what the year holds, and I certainly would like to know how the permutations of a pre-election year will impact the economic indices, ”Adeyemi noted.
