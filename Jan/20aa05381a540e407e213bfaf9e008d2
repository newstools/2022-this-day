Yinka Kolawole The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has declared restriction of movement from 11p.m. to 5a.m. daily, following a sudden rise in incidents of armed robbery within his domain. Confirming the development, the Lowa Adimula of Ife, High Chief Abraham Adekola, who is the third in line to Ooni, said the Ooni-in-Council had to put up the measure on behalf of the monarch, to curtail criminality in the town. Adekola, who said Oba Ogunwusi was in Sokoto on official assignment when the armed robbery incidents started happening, added that the palace chiefs had to act after briefing the royal father in a bid to arrest the situation. Adekola, who promised that no one would be molested before or during the curfew, said since the restriction was imposed, there was a drastic reduction in cases of armed robbery in the town. “It is true; restriction of movement had been imposed in the name of Baba Ooni. He is in Sokoto on an official assignment but after consultation with him, we agreed to impose restrictions from 11p.m. to 5a.m. daily until the situation improves.
“During the restriction, no night party, vigil or movement,” he said, adding that the measure “is is just to check criminality in the town. “Armed robbers had invaded Ife. They killed and maimed people. We just have to act to arrest the situation and since we imposed restrictions, the situation has improved. “Police, vigilantes and even chiefs are not sleeping. We are all involved. No one will be molested but we just want to check movement to stop the sudden rise in the armed robbery cases,” Adekola explained.
