Following a disappointing exit of the Nigerian Super Eagles from the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, Mr. Chika Ikenga, the Managing Director of Eunisell Limited, has urged the team to brush off the defeat in Cameroon and return to winning ways quickly. Ikenga explained that the final round of 2022 FIFA World Cup playoffs against Ghana in March presented a fresh opportunity for the team to excite Nigerian fans. The Eunisell boss said: “Eagles should use the loss as an opportunity to show resilience and put things in proper perspective. I urge them to quickly recover from the defeat and use the circumstance to grow and improve themselves for better performances in the future. “The Eagles must understand that they carry the hopes and aspirations of the nation. They should dig deep and apply themselves to work harder and ensure they qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. “They have a golden opportunity to win back the heart of disappointed Nigerian fans with the fast-approaching World Cup qualifiers against Ghana,” he noted. Ghana will host Nigeria at home in the first leg in March 2022 before playing away to Super Eagles in the second leg of the World Cup Qualifiers. Eunisell has been sponsoring Rivers FC United of Port Harcourt in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) since 2015 and an ardent advocate of developing Nigerian football. In 2018, it initiated and has since maintained the Eunisell Boot Award which honours and rewards highest goal scoring players with cash prizes at the end of the football season with a N200, 000 per goal premium.
