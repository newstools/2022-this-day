Friendship can be found in many places including the lowest places and amongst the elite. Regardless of how high and mighty or small people may appear, friendship is the glue that holds humanity together. This is true even for the long-term relationship between the CEO of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, and billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola. For men whose private decisions influence national economies, this friendship should not initially strike as uncommon. Dangote and Otedola control businesses with similar holdings in oil, energy, construction, real estate, and agriculture. To those who don’t know about their business-oriented relationship, it is surprising that Dangote can spearhead an integrated refinery complex worth $18 billion, the first of its kind in Nigeria, without a business backbone. Otedola is renowned for his unwavering respect for the older man, Dangote. The latter also celebrates Otedola’s successes and offers unlimited mentorship and guidance for business. It’s amazing to see tycoons who’ve plunged their feet deep into Nigeria’s lucrative sectors, sipping tea together and celebrating each other’s achievements. This is the ideal friendship goal—billionaires who share a strong bond despite a remarkable 11-year age difference. The billionaire duo is notable for combining forces whenever they wish to stage a major national surprise: whether it is hosting Anthony Joshua, attending award nights, financially supporting Nigeria’s Super Eagles, or planning getaway trips to chill. Their friendship sets the stage for budding entrepreneurs to see how businesses can thrive better on friendships and not necessarily stiff competition. The 2009 Chevron feud must have shown them the significance of friendship in a business partnership and united them more than ever. Dangote and Otedola amity validate the fact that even between Africa’s richest barons, there can be something nearly divine—such as a friendship made in heaven.
