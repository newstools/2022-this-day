Rebecca Ejifoma National Association of Nigerian Student Turkey Chapter (NANS TR) is desperately soliciting $8,000 to keep Blessing Chinekwu Okeke, a student who is suffering from brain tumour alive. Okeke, who lives and studies in Esenyurt, was said to be diagnosed with a brain tumor at a popular hospital in Istanbul, Hospital Reyab. “They are requesting $8000. The tumor is growing bigger everyday and if nothing is done in time her survival chance will be just five per cent,” the association said. Okeke is said to be in acute pain, hence, the need for immediate treatment. Donations can be sent to her dollar account, 85690920, IBAN number, TR560001000318856909205003 Blessing Chinekwu Okeke, Zirat Bank.
