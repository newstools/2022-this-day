Nume Ekeghe Sigma Pensions has emerged as one of the top all round performing pension fund administrator (PFA) across the pension industry, recording the highest number of top performance across the various RSA funds. Four out of six Sigma managed RSA funds finished the year 2021 as top-two performers across their respective categories. Unit price data collated from each PFA website and other sources revealed that out of 22 PFAs, Sigma Pensions was the best performing in Fund VI Active and Fund VI Retiree in 2021, 2nd best in Fund II and Fund IV and ranked 4th best in Fund III. The data gathered focused on the unit price growth trajectory from 31st December 2020, which was compared to that of 31st December 2021 in a bid to obtain the best performing funds for the year 2021. Analysis of the data showed that Sigma outshone its competitors in the newly introduced ethical fund (Fund VI), ranking the best performing growing at 5.55 per cent for active customers followed by FCMB Pensions and Premium Pensions growing at 3.65 per cent and 3.01 per cent respectively. And for retiree base, it grew at 5.39 per cent while Premium and Veritas grew at 2.02 per cent and 1.50 respectively.
