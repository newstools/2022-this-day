By Hammed Shittu Two persons have been reportedly killed at Mandate Food market Ilorin, Kwara State capital yesterday following the crisis that ensued in the market. The development, it was gathered, led to tension in the market as shop owners hurriedly closed their shops from fear of being attacked. THISDAY checks revealed that the incident resulted from the inability of the suspected hoodlums, who happened to be Hausa and Yoruba to agree on approved price of the products. It was learnt that the incident reportedly led to a free for all in the market as dangerous weapons were used leading to the death of the two people in the market. It was also learnt that some persons, who sustained injuries were rushed to the nearby general hospital. However, there were two accounts on the cause of the incident as some of the traders in the popular food market said that argument between two persons buying sugarcane led to the fight. Another version had it that some of the miscreants that usually milled around the market started the fight with one of the victims leading to pandemonium. Eyewitness’ account revealed that commercial activities were halted while the trouble lasted as mobile policemen later arrived to ensure normalcy returned to the market. The traders in the market, however, expressed apprehension of another possible attack if the issue is not well handled. Speaking on the development, the state Public Relations Officer of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Mr. Babawale Afolabi, who confirmed the incident, however, said that the command would soon issue official statement on the incident.
