John Shiklam in Kaduna The Kaduna State Ministry of Education has directed public schools in the state to migrate to the four-day working week introduced by the state government, as schools reopen yesterday for second session of the 2021/2022. The state Commissioner for Education, Halima Lawal, who gave the directive in a statement in Kaduna, also called on administrators and proprietors of public and private schools to sustain school-based security committees set up last term. The state government had in December 1, 2021, commenced transition to a four-day working week for its workers. The government had explained that the introduction of the four-day working week was “designed to boost productivity, improve work-life balance and enable workers to have more time for their families, to rest and for agricultural purposes.” The education commissioner said the 2021/2022 academic calendar would be adjusted to ensure coverage of the curriculum for the academic session. The commissioner also advised parents, guardians and students to comply with public health guidelines by adopting all protective measures against COVID-19. The statement urged “administrators and proprietors of public and private schools and other learning centres, including Islamiyya and Madrasas, to sustain school-based security committees set up last term, and to continue ensuring the safety of students in schools.” The commissioner added that: “The Safe School Learning Initiatives should be adhered to as directed by the Federal Ministry of Education. “Members of the school security committee should ensure proper monitoring of security apparatus and prompt reporting of any security threats in their schools by calling any of the following numbers: 09034000060 or 08170189999.”
