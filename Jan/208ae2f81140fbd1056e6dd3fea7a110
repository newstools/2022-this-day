Francis Sardauna in Katsina There was an unprecedented crowd at the Katsina State Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) secretariat following the formal declaration of Mr. Sirajo Aminu Makera to contest for Katsina Central senatorial seat on the platform of the party. Addressing officials of the PDP, Makera said he would soon unveil a policy document that will give a clear direction to the solutions that he hopes to bring to bear in the zone if elected as a senator comes 2023. He explained that his decision to vie for the Senate seat followed several months of consultations with critical stakeholders across the senatorial zone and PDP staunch members within and outside the state. He said: “I met with PDP officials at ward, local government and state levels to intimate them of my intention to contest the Katsina Central senatorial seat under the platform of our great party, the PDP, come 2023. “I believe I can do better. With my track record as the former General Manager of Katsina Housing Authority, my tenure was five times more productive than the whole tenure of the APC government in six years.” The former General Manager of the Katsina Housing Authority expressed his readiness to work assiduously with PDP stalwarts in the state in order to revive and reposition the main opposition party to win elections in 2023. He, however, implored “all members of our party to support the installed leadership and work together to rescue Nigeria from the deficient leadership of the APC-led government”. Speaking earlier, the former National Secretary of the PDP, Senator Ibrahim Umar Tsauri, lamented that the APC-led government has destroyed the socio-economic life of Nigerians, adding that insecurity had been the order of the day. He described the administration of Muhammadu Buhari as being the worst government in the history of Nigeria, even worse than the military government.
