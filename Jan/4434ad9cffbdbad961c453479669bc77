By Deji Elumoye, Sunday Aborisade and Amemeh Gabriel in Abuja The Senate, yesterday, asked President Muhammadu Buhari, to declare a full-fledged war on gunmen terrorising different parts of the country since they have been designated terrorists. The red chamber made the request following the consideration of a motion entitled: “Recent bandit attack in communities in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State: A call for action”, and sponsored by Senator Mohammed Sani Musa. The upper arm of the legislature commended the president for ordering air bombardment on the terrorists area of operation and also called on the federal government to declare a full-fledged war on the criminal elements since they have been declared as terrorists. While calling on the federal government to establish a military base in Shiroro, the Senate said the arrangement would help to restore confidence in the security and safety of the affected communities, in addition to safeguarding the national asset located within the area, such as the Shiroro Hydro-electric power dam. The Senate, therefore, directed the National Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) to provide relief materials and medical team to the victims immediately.
