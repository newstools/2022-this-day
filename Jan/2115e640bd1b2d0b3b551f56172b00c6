Deji Elumoye in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has stressed the need for leaders, especially in the West African sub-region, to do the best for their people, despite shrinking resources. The president spoke Friday at the State House, Abuja, while receiving in farewell audience, the Ambassador of Burkina Faso, Piabie Firmin Gregoire N’do, who spent eight years on tour of duty. He said: “Leaders should do the best for their people within the limits of resources.” President Buhari expressed hope that the outgoing envoy would use experiences garnered in the field “for decision making in your country when you go back”. Earlier in his speech, Ambassador N’do expressed the good wishes of his country and of himself to Nigeria, commending President Buhari for good diplomacy, which has seen Nigerians leading many international organizations. He equally expressed appreciation for different kinds of support from Nigeria to Burkina Faso during the flooding crisis, national elections and at many other critical times. The envoy said he enjoyed his stay in Nigeria, had his last daughter here and holds very pleasant memories of the country. President Buhari jocularly asked if he gave his daughter Nigerian names.
