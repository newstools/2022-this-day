Sunday Aborisade The Senate on Tuesday passed a bill to amend the Federal Colleges of Education Act 1998. It is titled: “A Bill for an Act to Repeal the Federal Colleges of Education Act, 1998” It was passed, following the consideration of a report by its Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND. Senator Sandy Onor presented the report on behalf of the Chairman, Ahmad Babba Kaita. Onor said the core objective of the bill was to provide for a legislative framework to support the Federal Colleges of Education Act, 1998. According to the lawmaker, it also seeks to re-enact the Federal Colleges of Education to allow the running of degree courses under the supervision of the National University Commission (NUC). He said: “Hitherto, most colleges in Nigeria offer degree programmes in affiliation with some universities in Nigeria to nurture career teachers with a view to augmenting shortfall of teachers and to meet learning, research, instructional and teaching needs of the prospective students in Nigeria and beyond. “However, this framework enables the colleges of education in Nigeria to offer Nigeria Certificate in Education (NCE), First Degree (B.sc/B.A) and similar certification in the area of its core subjects on both full-time and part-time basis.” He added that the legislation would be a lasting solution to the yearning of Nigerians in the area of teacher education within the context of overall national educational development agenda.
