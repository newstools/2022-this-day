By Francis Sardauna A civil society organisation, Partnership for Peace and Community Development (PPCD), has urged the federal government not to allow what it termed the unlawful activities of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to destabilize the unity and stability of Nigeria. The group said the government should not be deterred by the activities of the IPOB and their “faceless collaborators”, whom they said, were out to malign and distract innocent Nigerians from discharging their lawful businesses and constitutional rights. The Convener of PPCD, Muhammad Abbah Sada, disclosed this Wednesday while reacting to the recent call by the IPOB to ban the National Anthem and cow meat in the southern region of the country at a press conference, held at the Katsina NUJ secretariat. He explained that the recent “childish, reckless and unintelligent” threat of banning the Nigerian national anthem, as well as selling of cow meat in the South-east by IPOB, was an attempt to set the country on fire. He, however, urged Nigerian youths residing in the northern part of the country to remain calm irrespective of the activities of the IPOB for the interest of peace, unity and stability of the country. According to him, “After holistic appraisal of the issues and the pros and cons of the threat, PPCD has come to the conclusion that it is either IPOB is a fifth columnist that is out there to set the country on fire or are against the interest of the majority of the Igbo people residing in other parts of the country. “If not, why will you embark on an agenda that will threaten and endanger over 20 millions Igbo people living and cohabitating with their brothers in the northern part of the country peacefully for a very long time. “We at the partnership for peace and community development are convinced beyond reasonable doubt that recent activities of IPOB have shown that they are out there to disunite the country. ” He added that: “As we condemn the activities of IPOB, we wish to appeal to the state and federal governments to remain focused and undeterred in its duties by providing the basic necessities of life to Nigeria people.”
