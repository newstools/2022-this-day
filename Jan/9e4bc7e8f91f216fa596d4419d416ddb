Sylvester Idowu in Warri The people of Ozoro, in Isoko North Local Government Area of Delta State, recently protested the poor state of the General Hospital, Ozoro. In a peaceful protest, led by the President General of Ozoro Kingdom, Chief Miller Akpoili, the residents marched through some streets down to the hospital gate, to register their displeasure and disapproval of the poor condition of services in the hospital. The protesters carried different placards with inscriptions such as ‘No doctor, no nurses’, ‘Dead hospital’, ‘No General Hospital in Ozoro’, and so many others. They said the hospital, which was founded in 1953, required renovation and equipment adding that it also lacked many things, including manpower. According to the protesters, the people of the local government area receive no service from the hospital, saying that the facility lacked doctors and nurses. A resident, who simply identified himself as Mr Omovo, said, “The basic function of the government is to put in place health facilities, hospitals with qualified doctors, nurses and the best equipment to cater for the health of the citizens because health is life. “Ozoro with the highest population of Isoko nation, with a university, cannot sit down and watch while their citizens suffer poor health condition; people are being rushed to the hospital daily but no doctors, no nurses, no equipment to give assistance to the dying patients. “We the Ozoro people in general, use this peaceful protest to send a signal to our governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa and to all Ozoro sons and daughters working in all government organisations because we can no longer sit down and watch while our people keep dying every day. Come to our rescue by bringing more doctors, nurses and equipment to Ozoro General Hospital”, he said.
