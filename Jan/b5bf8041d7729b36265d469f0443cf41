Deji Elumoye in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has hailed the Super Eagles of Nigeria for an impressive start at the ongoing 33rd Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon, defeating a formidable opponent, Egypt 1-0, in their group stage encounter on Tuesday. The president, according to a release issued on Wednesday by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina, strongly believed, like millions of football-loving Nigerians, that the spectacular outing in Garoua, Cameroon is a foretaste of what to expect from the dedicated team as they square up against other opponents in the tournament. He, therefore, urged the Augustine Eguavoen-led team and the coaching staff to keep their eyes on the ball, remain good ambassadors on and off the field, and give loyal fans and all Nigerians more exciting moments to celebrate. President Buhari assured the team of his unflinching support as they soar like an eagle to write another chapter in the annals of Nigeria’s rich football history.
