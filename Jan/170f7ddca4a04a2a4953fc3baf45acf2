The Nigerian telecommu-nications company, Globacom, last week sponsored the annual carnival of the Benin Great GSM Village in Benin-city, Edo State. This year’s sponsorship is the second in the series following a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) the company signed with the association for exclusive branding of the village as well as sponsorship of the carnival for a period of five years. Speaking at the carnival, Globacom Head of Business, Mid-West, Mr. Augustus-Ndu Offor, said Globacom had always supported small and medium scale businesses in Nigeria, as they are the backbone of viable economies. He said: “The network has always empowered Nigerian youths to achieve their dreams and contribute to Nigeria’s economic development,” assuring the GSM Village of the company’s continued collaboration to enhance the growth of the association which provides jobs for thousands of Edo youths. Ndu-Offor expressed appreciation to the executives and members of the association for availing Globacom the opportunity to collaborate with them, and appealed to them to ensure that the facilities provided by Globacom were well utilised. The Chairman of the GSM Village, Mr. Aminu Abraham, praised Globacom for being a support base for the association, and prayed for more achievements for the company in the coming year. At a soccer tournament, which was one of the highlights of the festival, the Globacom representative presented awards to the best performing teams, while charging the teams to continue to do their best in their passion, which he said could be one of the ways of further putting the state on the world map. The Great GSM Village is the only recognised and registered association in Benin-city, Edo State, housing the full complement of ICT professionals empowered to train technicians in the repair of GSM products and sale of the devices.
