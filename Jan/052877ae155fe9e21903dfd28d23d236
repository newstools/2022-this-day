The Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP) in Edo State has encouraged residents of the state to embrace plastic waste recycling scheme to curb indiscriminate disposal of plastic, aluminium and other non-degradable waste materials. The Coordinator of Edo NEWMAP, Dr. Tom Obaseki, made the call during an address to stakeholders at a one-day training workshop on the pilot deployment of the “Pick and Sell” Android App. Obaseki said the unique model would make Edo one of the first states in Nigeria to deploy the tech-enabled scheme. He noted that the software would enable NEWMAP preserve physical infrastructure constructed for erosion and flood control, which requires enormous public resources. Addressing participants at the workshop, which comprised NEWMAP Community Interest Groups (CIGs) and other stakeholders, Obaseki urged them not to allow plastic and other non-degradable materials clog their newly constructed drainages and ponds within their domains and residences. He said that it was necessary to tackle the menace posed by waste to NEWMAP infrastructure by plastic so that the essence of committing public resources to the infrastructure investment would not be defeated.
