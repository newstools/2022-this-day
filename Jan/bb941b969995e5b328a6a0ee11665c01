According to a survey conducted by the AIS Workplace Stress Survey, workers are often burned out or stressed by their work and this in retrospect has a significant effect on their output at work. Consequently, employers and employees face work-life balance struggles, burnouts, growth stagnation and talent deficit which is why the need for a healthy workspace environment becomes more imperative. Speaking to this fact, the Group Managing Director, LandWey, Olawale Ayilara, in a statement issued by the company, mentioned that, “Most employers and even employees often battle the fear that the bigger a company grows, the more difficult it becomes to work in, especially in a fast-paced and competitive environment like ours in Nigeria. This is why we encourage healthy competition, reward great performance and support all our employees in their pursuit of excellence and this honor is a testament to this fact.” The Company’s Chief Operations Officer, Seun Eyitayo, expressed the importance of producing great talents; “We are in the business of producing the right workforce by creating a healthy environment that enables growth and productivity, invariably improving the real estate sector and the economy at large.”
