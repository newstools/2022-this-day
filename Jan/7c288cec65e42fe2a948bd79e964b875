Ake Ayodeji The 1989 set of Apostolic Church Grammar School, Ketu Lagos, has planned an inclusive scholarship programme and funding for students of the school as its little way of giving back. Speaking at the recent 2021 reunion held in Lagos, the set Coordinator, Mrs Temitope Adelela, said the general sets are preparing for the 58th reunion founder’s day in January 2022, where scholarship awards and fundraising are held will be done.
She added that the importance of the reunion is networking, reuniting, and helping one another, and cooperating on how to give back to the school. “This is our annual end of the year party for us to come together as a set because we call ourselves the unique set of 89. We have also planned the party in preparation for the 58th annual founder’s day coming up in January. We are trying to raise funds for the school and scholarship programs. “The Apostolic Church Grammar school is unique and we have a lot of people doing very well and they graduated from that school and the school is still doing well,” she said. Similarly, the set Assistant Coordinator, Mr. Jude Okotete, noted the scholarship had been designed for selected students who have done well in their academics. “It’s a get-together and because of the COVID-19, we couldn’t meet although we have had several virtual meetings. But we feel there is a need to come together as one family. “We are planning a meeting in January where some selected students will be honoured. We will honour the distinguished old student. We are working on scholarships and each set will contribute a million naira each for the program…We will consider the selected best students in the school. Apart from the school, we also empower ourselves because fingers are not equal,” he said
One of the members of the set, Adeyanjo Oluwafemi, commended the executives of the reunion for a job well done. He said: “We have been benefiting from this reunion. This is a platform put up so we can network.”
