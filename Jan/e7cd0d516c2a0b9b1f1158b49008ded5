Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti Nigerian Youth Congress (NYC), has lamented the persistent upsurge of kidnappings, killings, cattle rustling and banditry in the country, saying the obnoxious scenarios had been leading the youths from farming into menial jobs. NYC, therefore, called on the youth population to wake up from their slumber in 2022 and 2023 elections, by deploying their demographic strength in terms of vote population and launch themselves into relevance, by demanding what were due to them from leaders. NYC, which spoke in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State capital, yesterday, in a statement by its state Chairman, Tosin Adesuyi, regretted how Nigerian youths were being incapacitated through unemployment and lack of commitment to tackle insecurity that have affected their farming businesses and education, with cases of bombings, kidnappings and killings now being perpetrated in schools.

Many of them are now roaming the streets. “The greatest blow is the state of insecurity confronting some of us youth farmers, who have now retired from farming to menial jobs as means of survival after their lifetime investments were invaded and destroyed by herdsmen. “Whereas, the government at all levels preach diversification from oil-based economy to agriculture, but botched the diversification policy, by not paying attention or giving adequate measures to curb the insecurity, so that our colleagues can return to farming,” he said. Adesuyi, therefore, called on Fayemi to restructure the Ministry of Youth and bring in capable hands to man the post as good strategy to develop the population, saying the youth policy of the present government has allegedly failed to provide succour for his colleagues. “Youth development means transformation and much more to us than the cosmetics and window dressing affairs we have engaged i
