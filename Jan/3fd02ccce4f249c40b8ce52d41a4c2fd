Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki The Ebonyi State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has expressed excitement over the courage and determination of the state Governor, David Umahi, to run for the presidency in 2023. The state Chairman of the party, Chief Stanley Emegha, while briefing journalists in Abakaliki, noted that the APC is solidly behind the governor on his aspiration to run for the exalted seat. He stressed that he was confident that Umahi’s presidency would bring massive infrastructural development and economic prosperity to the Nigerian state and its citizenry considering his monumental achievements both in his private life and as a state governor According to him, “Let me inform Nigerians both at home and in the diaspora that Umahi’s decision to join the presidential race is the best thing that has happened to the country considering his precedent and genealogy. “Just like what he said on the Channels TV where he promised to replicate his progressive efforts in Ebonyi State at the national level. My governor is not contesting with anybody but with himself in total obedience with the party’s decision. “Those who knew Ebonyi State before the coming of Umahi can be the judge. Under Umahi, the state has been transformed and now competes with developed countries. Aside the road network in the state, there has been constant street lighting since he took over the mantle of leadership.” The APC state chairman, who also doubles as the Special Security Consultant to the state government, Emegha, said apart from the massive infrastructural development, the administration of Umahi has also brought an appreciable level of peace to the people, thereby making life more meaningful and satisfying. He said: “I therefore call on all Nigerians, irrespective of ethnicity, belief and other attachments, to please key into this dream of making the country greater by supporting Umahi to become the next president of Nigeria.”
