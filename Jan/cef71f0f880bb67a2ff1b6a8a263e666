pThe University of Lagos has postponed the 2021/2022 matriculation ceremony earlier scheduled for today. This was contained in a statement signed by the acting Dean, Student Affairs Division, Dr. Musa Obalola.
According to him, the postponement is due to “unforeseen circumstances.” He noted that the new date for the ceremony is Friday, January 28, while expressing regret over all inconveniences the postponement must have caused the public. Meanwhile, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe has deployed 500 tablets to the institution’s library. A statement by the University Librarian, Prof. Yetunde Zaid, explained that the aim of the initiative was to enhance access to learning resources for the students and other library users. According to Zaid, the tablets are to be loaned out to students for a period of two weeks, just like books are loaned out. She added that a loan firm had been designed for that purpose. “The tablets will enable students to search the library online catalogue for print resources, as well as read e-books and e-journals, which are accessible on the library website,” she stated. A Nigerian business man, Dr. Jim Ovia had during the institution’s last convocation, donated a total of 3,500 tablets to indigent students of the university, to ease e-learning.
