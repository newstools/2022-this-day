From Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed has received scores of All Progressives Congress (APC) members at Awalah area of Bauchi metropolis who defected to the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. Following their defection on Sunday, they were led to the State Governor to formally receive them into the ruling party in the state by his Senior Special Assistant on Youths Affairs, Alhaji Bala Saleh Chiroma. The defectors also handed over the APC office they were previously using to the Governor to serve as an office for PDP. Inaugurating the office, the governor commended the defectors for taking the bold step of dumping APC for PDP. Mohammed assured them that his administration would carry every member of the party along, saying that they would be treated as full members of PDP and advised them to register and get their new party’s membership card from their respective wards. Governor Mohammed, however, urged the new PDP members to not only educate other members of APC about the good things the PDP government was doing in the state but also to mobilise them to join the ruling party in the state. Spokesperson of the defectors explained that they decided to dump APC as a result of the various developmental projects spread across the state by the Governor Mohammed-led PDP administration in the state. According to him, the development being witnessed in the state in the past two years of the Mohammed administration was unlike what happened when an APC-led administration ruled the state for four years. He then pledged their continuous support for the PDP administration with a view to ensuring its success, promising that for them, 2023 Governorship election is a done deal as far as the Governor Mohammed is concerned.
