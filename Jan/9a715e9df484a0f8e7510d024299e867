Rebecca Ejifoma The Commissioner for Health Lagos State, Professor Akin Abayomi, has warned that Omicron is the predominant virus currently in the state following a wildfire experience during the Yuletide. Abayomi made this disclosure during an interview session on ARISE Television on the current health status of Lagos State. He said: “We’ve done our sequence analysis and we have given that result to the Presidential Steering Committee. Our data shows that the predominant virus in circulation in Lagos State now is Omicron.” Abayomi further conceded that from their data and the clinical picture it is obvious, the ability of this new variant to spread rapidly is what they are seeing in other parts of the world. “It’s not really going for the respiratory system. So the pattern is consistent. “Our genetic sequencing is matching what we are seeing in the clinical arena. And the fourth wave as we predicted was going to have a very sharp rise and a very sharp down stroke,” he said. He disclosed that Omicron went through Lagos like a wildfire. “I think everyone recognises that at one point around Christmas and the New Year, there wasn’t a household that didn’t have somebody with a respiratory tract infection feeling awful, but not a respiratory failure.”
