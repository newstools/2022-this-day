Nume Ekeghe A Fintech company empowering the offline to online transitioning for organisations, businesses, and entrepreneurs, PayedIn Technology has launched a simple to use payment solution in Nigeria. In a statement, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, PayedIn Debo Shopade states: “We have developed a payment platform that is easy-to-use and secure without the need for hardware, intermediaries or systems integration. To get started, recipients only need to go through a simple sign-up process. “In support of digitalisation of the economy, all organisations, businesses, and entrepreneurs should have access to a secure and easy-to-use electronic payment solution. The current crop of payment solutions available in the country are complex and often require complicated hardware, payment intermediaries or complex systems integration. What this means is that only the top 20% of organisations, businesses and entrepreneurs with the requisite skills, capabilities, and resources are enjoying cashless payments.” Also commenting on the launch, Co-Founder and CTO, PayedIn Aditya Padhi said: “ PayedIn is secure by design with state-of-the-art security features including email and phone number verification, two-factor authentication and biometric security to keep transactions secure. Our Payment solutions is available for all major sectors of the economy including utility, services, transportation, education, e-commerce, charity, and religious sectors. “Features for payment recipients include payment links for remote payments, integrated transaction-reporting dashboard, scan to pay, crowd funding and instant payment notifications. Features for those making payments include scan (QR code) to pay, pay by link, location triggered payments, recurring payments, push notifications, transaction receipts and transaction reports. PayedIn is available on all platforms including web, iOS and Android mobile apps stores.”
