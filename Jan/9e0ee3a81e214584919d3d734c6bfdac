Chuks Okocha in Abuja A Yoruba self-determination group, the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), has said it has no form of connection with Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, APC national leader, Bola Tinubu and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, as potential presidential hopefuls as the nation journeys through 2023 general election. Image maker of group, Yinka Oguntimehin, in a statement, said the organisation was not involved with a “Mega Accord of 57 civil society groups calling for southwest presidential candidate”, adding that those who added the name of OPC at a recent meeting were only being fraudulent. The spokesman said the Gani Adams-led body at no time announced it was mobilising for any politician or party, reiterating that Nigeria’s problem could only be addressed through restructuring, to allow regions develop at their own pace as it was in the 1960 and 1963 constitutions. “We are aware that when elections are approaching, some politicians usually use the OPC’s name to curry favours. There are some groups that are affiliates of political parties that usually make themselves available for politicians as at when due,” Oguntimehin said, stressing that those fronting as OPC members had no known ideals, programmes or activities. His words: “When anything happens in Yorubaland, you don’t hear their voices, except during elections or when they are paid to issue statements against us. Even if an angel emerges the president of this nation today, without restructuring, nothing will change for the better. “Our position on the future of Nigeria is clearly stated in our belief in restructuring. That is why we root for regionalism as the best option for peace and stability,” the group said, warning persons or groups using the OPC to gain popularity or influence to stop or face appropriate actions.
