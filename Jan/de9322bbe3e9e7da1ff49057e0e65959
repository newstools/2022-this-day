By Vanessa Obioha Following the spike in COVID-19 cases in the United States, the Recording Academy has postponed the 64th Grammy awards earlier scheduled for January 31. It is the second time the award is being postponed due to the pandemic. Last year’s ceremony was extended by six weeks. According to a statement by the Recording Academy, “After careful consideration and analysis with city and state officials, health and safety experts, the artist community and our many partners, the Recording Academy® and CBS have postponed the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards® Show. “The health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience, and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly to produce our show remain our top priority. Given the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant, holding the show on January 31 simply contains too many risks.” This year’s Grammy nominations have Nigerian artists nominated in the Global Music Album and Global Music Performance categories. Burna Boy and Wizkid who won a Grammy last year are among this year’s nominees. Femi Kuti, who is no stranger to the Grammys, fetched two nominations in both categories. His son Made however shares the spotlight with him in the Global Music Album category. Another newcomer is Tems, who shares the spotlight with Wizkid for their song ‘Essence’. A new date for the Grammys is yet to be communicated.
