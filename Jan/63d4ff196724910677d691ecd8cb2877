This week’s FEC meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja on Wednesday, considered the request to make additional funding provision to enable government meet the incremental fuel subsidy payment in the 2022 budget. Ahmed, who revealed this during the post-FEC briefing, recalled that only N443 billion is presently available in the 2022 budget meant to accommodate subsidy from January to June.

She said the request was considered by FEC, which directed the ministry to approach the National Assembly for an amendment to the fiscal framework as well as the budget. Details later…
