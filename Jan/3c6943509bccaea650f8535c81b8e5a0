Quadri Aruna has broken his own record to achieve a new feat in the world ranking after the Nigerian yesterday hit 11th spot in the February 2022 ITTF world rating. After his quarterfinal finish at the 2021 World Championships in Houston, United States, Aruna rose to 14th in the world to become the first African in history to reach that height. However, the former African champion raised the bar for players from the continent with the new ranking as the first athlete to hit 11th spot in the world.
