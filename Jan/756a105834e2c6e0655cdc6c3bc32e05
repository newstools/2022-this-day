Yet another year and the return to Colleges and Universities is actually a return to the bedroom and back online. This really is just a computer simulation of the real education experience. There will be no boring, old lecturer with a PowerPoint from the 90’s – actually that won’t change. There won’t be a food court to waste time discussing how you will change the world for the better. There won’t be 100 people to chat to/chat up as Zoom isn’t that private. Online learning is like a Western movie without John Wayne, it’s just not as good. Good luck with the screen work and hope that the lecturer doesn’t always use the mute button. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne, Australia
