Nobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, has disowned a social media post which claimed he would back All Progressives Congress leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s presidential bid. One Michael Olugbenga Peter had posted on his facebook page, a comment purportedly made by Soyinka that he would be involved in politics to campaign for Tinubu’s 2023 presidential bid because of their National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) background. Refuting the facebook post, in a statement, Prof Soyinka described it as “an ancient forgery being recycled for the umpteenth time”. See full statement by Prof Soyinka: Here we go again the same boring illiterate public interlopers who lack the courage of their conviction and must steal the identities of their betters. One can only hope that the public has learnt to identify FAKE NEWS and join in the urgent task of exposing and disgracing these despicable touts. For the avoidance of doubt I have not even THOUGHT 2023 much less inserted candidates into coveted positions. The signature of this latest moron is familiar – he or she does not even know the difference between “Laureate and Laurel”. This is an ancient forgery being recycled for the umpteenth time. Those who pass it round do themselves and their recipients a disservice. Find something worthwhile to occupy your time.In any case we have no business with politics in the land of the dead and the most recent information I have on me is that I died some time last year. The email account of the year’s Nobel “Laurel” was hacked by these same agents to publicise my demise so who is this still politicking WS “Laurel”? – Wole SOYINKA See Facebook Post <img src="https://i2.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/3bfd6528-whatsapp-image-2022-01-13-at-2.01.35-pm.jpeg?w=696&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" />
