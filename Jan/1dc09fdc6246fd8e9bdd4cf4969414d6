He added that the agency will work in conjunction with the Nigeria Customs Service to tackle smugglers in the border towns across the state. Ayinla also hinted about the preparedness of NSCDC to keep 24 hours surveillance on Correctional Centres to forestall any breach of security in the facilities following the latest incident that saw three inmates escape from Mandalla in Kwara. He said that the agency will intensify efforts on the training of its officers, especially on how to handle weapon, intelligence and information gathering to further aid their performance.
