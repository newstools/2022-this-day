Great expectations glows in the horizon for the Nigerian arts scene this year, says Yinka Olatunbosun Nollywood, Nigeria’s 3-billion-dollar film industry, known for its savvy stars, directors and producers has been a subject of global interest and curiosity for years. To make history, Nigerian-American artist Iké Udé has documented celebrities in Nollywood through photography and the pieces will be exhibited in a show that kicks off on February 5 at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African Arts in Washington DC. In this exhibition, Udé’s portraits make a glamorous, bold statement about African identity as an artistic response to the vestiges of colonialism and widespread racism that still threaten black lives on a daily basis. Each portrait embodies radical beauty by reclaiming, reconstructing, and redefining notions of African identity. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/cd0bcae9-artscover.jpg?w=696&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> ‘Stories of A Generation’ a Netflix documentary series which hit the streaming platform on December 25 features-amongst others- Nigeria’s leading female gallerist and artist known for textile art, Nike Davies-Okundaye.
