Mary Nnah Regardless of religion, tribe, and ethnicity, Dr. Siju Iluyomade has continued to give her all to better the life of many, using her Arise Women Foundation to intervene in so many areas of human needs. Her efforts to empower the less privileged people and support the effort of government in every area of endeavour has been acclaimed to be one of the most outstanding among the lots, who follow the same passion as hers.
