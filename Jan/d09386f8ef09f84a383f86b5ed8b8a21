*Says Nnamdi Kalu will have his day in court *Opposes creation of state police Deji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed his readiness to sign the 2021 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill into law as soon as the National Assembly removes the provision for direct primaries for political parties in the bill. Answering questions on a national television programme on Wednesday, the President claimed imposing direct primaries on parties was a clear violation of the rights of individuals which informed why he refused assent to the bill.

According to him: “I’m not for creation of state police as this will not solve the issue of security challenges across the country”. Details later…
