The Executive Chairman of OGIRS, Mr. Olugbenga Olaleye stated this in Abeokuta, during a one-day budget strategy session, promising that the agency would ensure the state delivers more than the targeted N155 billion Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), while leveraging on the digitalisation efforts. He added: “The percentage increase over last year budget figure necessitated the collective efforts geared towards blocking and bringing all revenue leakages into the government coffers. “When all units and MDAs work together, share ideas and information, area of leakages and more revenue opportunities will be identified.” Olaleye enjoined all taxable adults in the state to pay appropriate taxes as and when due to complement government’s efforts, to enable it provide more social amenities in line with electoral mandates. in his contribution, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Revenue, Mr. Abiodun Adeleye said the programme was put together for revenue officers to rub minds, reflect on last year performance and strategise on how best to expand tax net, boost revenue generation and surpass the targeted revenue figure for 2022.
