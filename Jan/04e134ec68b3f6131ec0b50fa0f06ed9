It is expected that most PFAs will divert from GTCO stock until after five years. Based on that, a lot of investors started taking profit-taking in GTCO, leading decline in 2021. “Also, the poor performance of Stanbic IBTC Holdings in nine months of 2021 discouraged investors, a major reason for the decline in stock price recorded in 2021.”

Speaking with THISDAY, doyen of the market, Mr. Rasheed Yusuf said highly capitalised companies listed on the NGX in 2021 faced numerous domestic and foreign challenges.
He noted that the stock market performance is a reflection of the operating environment orchestrated by COVID-19 pandemic. According to him: “The performance of companies’ stock price is a reflection of current economy reality and as you likely know, the pandemic brought the world economy to a standstill in 2021. The dominant concern was based on how to survive, coupled with virtual communication. “I think the underline consideration is operating environment and how many companies were able to survive. Most of the companies on NGX have done well despite profit-taking in stock prices and weak corporate earnings. I think we should commend these companies for surviving 2021 macro economy challenges and be hopeful that in 2022, we should be looking at improved appreciation in stock prices. “Our expectation should be, with the ease of movement with the benefit technology has also opened new ground, therefore, 2022 should be a year of manifestation of impressive corporate earnings and foreign investors returning to the stock market.” The Vice President, Highcap Securities Limited, Mr. David Adnori, the weight of highly capitalized stocks listed on the NGX do contribute immensely to the performance of the NSE ASI and market capitalisation on daily basis. Adnori said: “More importantly, this weighty contribution to the performance is more reflective in the market breadth position recorded in any trading day activities. Despite a negative market breadth, a positive movement in the stock price of any of the highly capitalized stocks could drive the NSE ASI to positive territory and sometimes, the reverse is the case. “These companies’ performance is a reflection of the Nigeria economy and we expected foreign and domestic investors to trade caution in some of these companies.”
Adnori added that the stock market in 2021 faced volatility, especially from foreign investors as interest in fixed income securities improved. He noted that the double-digit inflation, foreign exchange scarcity, and security were concerns to foreign investors, stressing that most of the highly capitalised were affected by these factors in 2021.
