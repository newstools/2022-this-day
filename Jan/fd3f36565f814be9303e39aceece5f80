Ahead of the February 26 national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senate Chief Whip and former Abia State Governor, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, on Sunday night paid a solidarity visit to the national chairmanship hopeful of the party, Senator Sani Musa. Kalu, who is also a presidential aspirant in the governing APC, said he was at the Maitama residence of the Senate Service Committee Chairman on a solidarity visit to the recuperating chairmanship aspirant who just returned from a medical trip abroad. Kalu praised the chairmanship aspirant for being very proactive and in pursuance of ways to move the APC to electoral victories in all elections. The former Abia governor then reaffirmed his preparedness to aspire for the Presidency of the country if the party zones it to the South. The two leaders discussed ways of improving the fortunes of the party, how to ensure a rancour-free forthcoming national convention of the party and agreed to work together for the electoral success of the APC at all levels in future elections. Senator Musa expressed gratitude to the Chief Whip for deeming it fit to visit and check on him after his treatment. He thanked Kalu for his humility and sense of leadership.
