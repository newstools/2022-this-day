Musa, who’s wearing the Nigerian national team’s armband, in an interview with Egyptian publication, Kingfut.comsaid that the ongoing tournament is special to him and could be his last. “I think this could be my last Africa Cup of Nations with Nigeria,” Musa said. “I explained the importance of this edition of AFCON to my teammates, and I told them winning the title is the only thing they can gift me, and they told me they are going for it,” revealed the Fatih Karamgumruk of Turkish lig winger “My first tournament with Nigeria was the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, where we successfully won the title, and my second appearance was in Egypt where we finished third.
