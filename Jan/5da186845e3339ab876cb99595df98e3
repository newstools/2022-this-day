House of Representatives aspirant for Ijebu North, East, and Ogun Waterside Federal Constituency, Damilola Otubanjo, has commended Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun it, on the completion of 42-kilometer Sagamu Interchange-Abeokuta dual carriageway for the good of the people. Otubanjo, an engineer, made this remark ahead of President Muhammadu Buhari’s one-day working visit and project commissioning ceremony. She described the projects to be commissioned by the president as a dividend of true governance by the All Progressives Congress (APC). The aspirant, who is also a philanthropist, hinted that the projects remain facilities that meet the yearnings of both indigenes and non-indigenes in the state. While describing the governor as one who considers welfare and commerce as important needs, Otubanjo noted, “He has been instrumental in boosting the standard of living through the completion of key landmark projects across Ogun”. She further explained that the Sagamu interchange-Abeokuta road would reduce travel time and ease the movement of goods and services from factories across the state. For her, this feat is a landmark road network that must be commended. On the housing project, she disclosed that the Kobape Estate indicated the governor’s drive to mitigate the housing deficit and ensure the urbanisation of the state. According to the aspirant and entrepreneur,  beneficiaries of these drives will always be the people he has chosen to serve. She emphasised: “As a citizen of the state, I key into this project and others and applaud my governor, Dapo Abiodun, on such worthy steps of the colossus of development we are blessed with. While pledging allegiance to the service of the state, Otubanjo listed other projects including the new Kobape Housing Estate, and the first phase of Kings Court  Estate, Abeokuta.
