Reacting to the passenger upsurge since the lockdown in early 2020, industry expert and Managing Director of Flights and Logistics Solutions Limited, Amos Akpan, told THISDAY that people were desperate to recover their businesses, their investments so there was rush travel and do business. Akpan stated, “People came out to recover what they have lost or were losing. Airlines that rested their planes had to bring them out and put them in the air to make money. “People had to go back to their businesses. Those who took loans have to service the loans. So, there was the need by the private sector and the government to kick-start the economy after the COVID-19 devastation.” Travel expert and consultant, Ambassador Ikechi Uko, said there was global pressure for recovery, noting that domestic airlines recovered quickly because Nigeria had only one lockdown, so recovery was not interrupted by another lockdown.
