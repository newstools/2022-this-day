Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo The Catholic Diocese of Umuahia has formally unveiled its new institution, the Madonna College of Health Technology (MACOHTECH), Olokoro, Umuahia, set up to train healthcare technicians. The Catholic Bishop of Umuahia, Most Rev. Lucius Ugorji, stated that MACOHTECH would provide youths with the needed skill to function effectively and make a living in the health sector. Speaking during the first matriculation ceremony of the institution, the pioneer Provost, Rev. Fr. Christian Anokwuru, said, “We are here to raise excellent and responsible health professionals, who will stand out from the crowd through their character and quality training.” He further stated that with its state-of-the-art equipment, facilities and qualified academic and non-academic staff, MACOHTECH would bridge the manpower gap in healthcare technicians. Aside from training the allied health professionals, the provost said the institution would positively impact the host community by providing healthcare services as its Community Health Department will offer maternal-child care. The Chairman of the Governing Council of the College, Prof. Hilary Edeoga, former vice-chancellor of Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike (MOUAU), assured that the institution would live up to expectations. MACOHTECH took off in November 2020 with 25 pioneer students, but the students’ population has risen to 200 across the four departments.
