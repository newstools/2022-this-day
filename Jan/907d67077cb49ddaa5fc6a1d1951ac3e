While some Nigerians abroad keep tarnishing the image of the country with shady businesses, Somodale Olufunke Dosunmu is representing her fatherland with great pride. The London-based lady, who is the brains behind the popular SKD Event Planning Services, has disclosed that though she did not study food-related courses, her great culinary skill is a natural talent. Shomzys, as she is fondly called, disclosed that she had only turned her hobby that grew while she was an undergraduate of Physical Health Education at Lagos State University, into a money-making venture. She also recalled that while she was in the university, she was catering to neighbours and friends for free when she was living with her parents. Dosunmu, who talked about budgeting and finance as some of the challenges she faced on the job, added that only people who understand the intricacies of culinary business appreciate the enormity of work involved. “A lot still feel we are expensive, but we are not,” she stated. Dosunmu, who obtained her Master’s degree from the University of Ibadan, left for the United Kingdom in 2003. Subsequently, she continued with the same vigour where she also got the certification for Food Safety in Catering from the Institute of Hospitality. In 2015, she bagged Early Years Postgraduate Studies at Middlesex University. Interestingly, catering is not her only business, as SKD also engages in gift items, souvenirs, African fabrics predominantly made in Nigeria and a bit of import and export business for clients who have their events within and outside the UK. At the moment, her popularity is spreading beyond the UK across Europe, where she engages in food and catering services. Even though she works at NHS part-time, she has carved a niche for herself in the business and got a sizable number of projects lined up in the new year.
