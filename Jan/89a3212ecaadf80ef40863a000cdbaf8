Adeola disclosed that personnel cost was based on staff strength on the payroll including social benefits such as NHIS, pension contribution among others, and anticipated performance bonus for the year. He attributed the increase in overhead projection to the need for more robust operational activities, which has a direct relationship with overhead budget lines such as electricity tariff, generator fuel cost, legal services due to tax disputes, local travels, transport and critical ones that relate directly to tax collection and administration. The lawmaker added that capital cost estimates reported include on-going and new projects which are to be executed during the 2022 financial year. He said: “These are a result of expected completion of projects, payment of retention on completed projects and some new projects for effective revenue drive. “The Service collected N4.53 trillion as at 31st October, 2021 out of the total projected revenue target of N7.61 trillion which represents 60 per cent achievement. “The performance based on the target for the period of N6.34 trillion represents 71 per cent achievement. “The non-oil component of the tax collected stands at N3.5 trillion and represents 63 per cent achievement of total non-oil revenue target of N5.6 trillion.”
