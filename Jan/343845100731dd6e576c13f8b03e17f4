Folalumi Alaran in Abuja The Chairman of the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Hon. Abdullahi Adamu, has urged all traditional rulers in the AMAC zone to avoid being sentimental in the upcoming election, and that they should guarantee that all political candidates, regardless of their religious beliefs or state of origin, would be given equal opportunities. The chairman, who stated this during a town hall meeting with traditional rulers last Monday, explained that it was in response to a regrettable incident in a community in Kabusa specifically in a village called Keti, where a party candidate was unable to conduct a peaceful campaign let alone canvass for votes. He stated that 95 percent of polling units are in the communities, therefore, traditional rulers should be more tolerant of the candidates and ensure that the upcoming election is peaceful and free of violence. Adamu said: “The INEC headquarters have released the timetable for the conduct of the February election. “We have a directive from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to inform you that no traditional rulers should allow his community to be a breeding ground for political crisis. “The government told us to tell you that they are not going to take it lightly, we are reporting directly what the government wants, which is a peaceful conduct of election from start to finish. “In every community, there is a traditional ruler who looks after it. So we felt that as a government, we should try to put a stop to any form of crises in the areas.”
