*Says though team failed to perform, it deserves commendation Deji Elumoye in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has told Nigerians not to write off the nation’s senior national team, the Super Eagles, despite failing to qualify for the next round in the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON) taking place in Cameroon. The President, in a reaction on Monday evening by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, to the loss by Nigeria’s Super Eagles Football Team to Tunisia on Sunday in Garoua, Cameroon, said though the team did not live up to expectations in the tournament, both officials and players deserve commendation for the tough fight they put up. According to him: “They gave everyone the confidence that they were up to it, and I am sure it was something they could have achieved. Nonetheless, we should not write them off”. President Buhari urged Nigerians to encourage the players to do better next time, especially in view of the World Cup qualification matches that have been lined up for them. He, therefore, directed Nogeria’s football authorities to undertake a critical assessment on the Eagles’ performance at the Cup of Nations tournament “and encouraged the general public to send their suggestions to the Nigeria Football Federation so that it will reflect and plan well for a better outing in the forthcoming World Cup competition”.
