Deji Elumoye in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, as he marks his 63rd birthday on January 12, 2022. The president, in a statement on Tuesday by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina, joined Lawan’s family, friends and the National Assembly “to celebrate with the political leader”. He congratulated the distinguished senator on the strides so far in providing an inclusive and responsive leadership at the Upper Chamber, using his many years of experience, since 2003, to guide the collective wisdom of the Senate in pursuit of the national interest. President Buhari noted the contributions of Lawan to the political and economic development of the country, starting out as a lecturer, before accepting to serve his constituency as a legislator. The president believes the Senate President’s visionary leadership style, with a strong penchant for always finding a common ground with the executive arm of government, has been most rewarding for the country, especially in the passage of bills that directly impact on the livelihood of the people. President Buhari, therefore, prayed for Lawan’s good health, strength and more wisdom to guide the affairs of the Senate.
