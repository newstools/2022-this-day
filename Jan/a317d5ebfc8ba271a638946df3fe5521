It was learnt that the armed men stormed Batagari village in Maikujeri district of Rafi Local Government of the state at about 10pm on Saturday. THISDAY learnt that the gunmen rode on motorcycles into the village and shot indiscriminately into the air to instil fears in the villagers after which they started moving from house to house ransacking the buildings and taking away their valuable properties.
