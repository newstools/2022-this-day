Deji Elumoye in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the death of a great statesman and former Head of the Interim National Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan.
The President, in a release issued on Tuesday by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina, on behalf of the Federal Government, extended deepest condolences to Chief Shonekan’s wife, Margaret, loved ones, as well as the government and people of Ogun State.
As an internationally-respected statesman, President Buhari affirmed that, with courageous wisdom, Chief Shonekan left his flourishing business career to become the Head of Government, at a delicate time when the country needed someone of his calm mien and pedigree to save the ship of state from sinking.
The President noted that Chief Shonekan demonstrated to all that the love for country and commitment to her development, peace and unity transcend the trappings of office and the transient nature of political power.
President Buhari believed that Nigeria owes a great debt to Chief Shonekan, the peacemaker, who even at the twilight of his life time never stopped believing and working for a prosperous and democratic country.
The President prayed that the memory of the departed Head of Government will remain a blessing to Nigeria even as he finds perfect peace with Almighty God.
