Two Africa Cup of Nations matches will be relocated from Japoma Stadium in Douala to Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaounde, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) announced on Wednesday. One quarterfinal and the February 2 semifinal will be moved to the Cameroonian capital city. CAF President, Patrice Motsepe, had said on Tuesday the quarterfinal due to be played at the Olembe Stadium in Yaounde will be switched to the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium after a deadly crush which killed eight people. The decision to shift that match away from the 60 000-seat Olembe Stadium was confirmed on Wednesday after Motsepe hosted a meeting with tournament organisers. “The next match that was scheduled for the Olembe Stadium will not take place until CAF and the Local Organising Committee have received the full report of the Investigation Committee (into the Olembe incident) indicating the circumstances and events that led to the injury and death of spectators at the Olembe Stadium,” CAF said in a statement. The second semifinal, to be played February 3, is still scheduled at Olembe Stadium for the time being. “The CAF AFCON Organising Committee also requires the assurance and guarantee that appropriate and adequate interventions and measures have been implemented to ensure that a similar incident will not occur,” the statement added.
