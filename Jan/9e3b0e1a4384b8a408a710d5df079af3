Arsenal lost to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round for the second time in four years thanks to Lewis Grabban’s late strike. The visitors seemed to have turned a corner of late but were deservedly beaten 1-0. at a noisy City Ground. Mikel Arteta made numerous changes to his line-up but there was still a strong core to his team. Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and the in-form Gabriel Martinelli were among those in the side. Forest, who beat the Gunners 4-2 at the same stage in 2018 and who have not lost a home tie in six years, were physical from the start. Debutant Kienan Davis, leading the line after completing a loan move from Aston Villa, caused problems for the visiting defence during a first half in which Arsenal failed to assert themselves.
