Bennett Oghifo BMW Manufacturing has said it set a new production record during 2021, producing 433,810 BMW X vehicles during the year. The automaker said in a statement that “This is a 20 per cent increase over last year’s production and breaks the previous record of 411,620 units set in 2019.” Additionally, the plant produced a record number of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) last year with about 70,000 units shipped. “The fact that the Plant Spartanburg team set a production record during a very unpredictable year is a testament to the commitment and flexibility of our associates,” said Dr. Robert Engelhorn, president and CEO of BMW Manufacturing. “Our associates continue to build premium quality products that are in high demand by our customers around the world.” The 2021 production year marked the fourth time the South Carolina plant has topped 400,000 units. This milestone was also achieved in 2015 (400,904 units), 2016 (411,171), and 2019 (411,620).

We look forward to adding the all-new BMW XM to the Plant Spartanburg family of X models. Series production of the BMW XM, the first plug-in hybrid high-performance model in the BMW M portfolio, will begin in late 2022.” BMW Manufacturing contributed significantly to the company’s U.S. sales success during 2021.
