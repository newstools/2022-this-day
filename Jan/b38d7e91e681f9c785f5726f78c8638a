The Art and Design Teacher at Greensprings School, Anthony Campus, Mrs. Anuoluwapo Adeyemi, has called on more schools in the country to promote art and fashion studies. Speaking recently at a fashion show organised by the school’s students, Adeyemi said organising art exhibitions and fashion shows could support raising a generation that would take art and fashion to the next level. She said the school recently held its 2021 fashion show, themed ‘The New Normal: #MixedMediaExpression, and based on the theme, the students showcased six clothing lines that brilliantly incorporated facemasks into their designs. “Through the guidance of the teachers, our promising clothing liners did the sketching of their designs, sourced the fabrics, made the dresses, and managed fellow students who modelled the designs,” stated Adeyemi. She described the show as a success because it made the students see that they can also express their creativity by organising impressive fashion shows like the one they see on TV. “From our students’ performance during the show, it is obvious that Nigeria is blessed with a lot of young talents and I believe that our art and fashion industry would receive more global recognition in years to come, especially if more schools give extra attention to creatively teaching the subject, as well as organising art exhibitions and fashion shows,” she added.
