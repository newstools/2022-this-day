The Edo State Government has mourned the death of the Chairman of the Edo State chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Sunny Osayande.
The Edo State Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa Esq., in a statement, described Osayande as a labour veteran and expert in dispute resolution, who made indelible contributions to ensuring cordial relations between the organised labour and the state government.
According to him, “It is with shock and a heavy heart that the Edo State government received the sad news of the demise of Comrade Sunday Osayende, a veteran labour leader who worked for the best interest of Edo State and its people.
“It is sad to note that the amiable labour leader exited this world at a time his services are most needed in the state. An expert at dispute resolution, the departed labour leader believed in diplomacy and ‘voice of reason’ in the resolution of issues.
It is on record that he played pivotal roles in the peaceful and cordial relationship between goverment and labour. A trained and experienced labour leader, the the advisory roles which he played on crucial state issues which the state goverment found useful earned him great respect from government and organised labour.
“Comrade Osayende was a role model to young labour leaders as well as aspiring ones.His legacies as a labour leader and activist stand tall in our dear state.The state government conveys it’s heartfelt condolences to his wife,children,other members of his family and the labour community.”
The government condoled workers in Edo State, the organised labour movement and the NLC over Osayande’s passing, praying that God will grant all the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
