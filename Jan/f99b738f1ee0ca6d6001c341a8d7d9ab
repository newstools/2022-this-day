Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Katsina State has called on the state Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, to dissolve the governing council of the Umaru Musa Yar’Adua University (UMYU) over alleged financial racketeering. The coalition also called on the governor to suspend the management of the university and constitute a visitation panel to investigate all the allegations leveled against the leadership of the school. In an interview with journalists yesterday, the Chairman of the coalition, AbdurRahman Abdullahi, alleged that the Vice Chancellor of the state-owned university, Professor Sanusi Mamman, shared $2,100 to members of the council to blanket his ongoing investigation. He said: “If $2,100 can be shared among members of the governing council in a suspected fraudulent manner that means the integrity of the council itself has been compromised. “For that reason, the governor, being the visitor to the university and based on the power given to him by the law establishing the university, should dissolve the governing council of the university because its integrity has been compromised.” He explained that the action of the university’s governing council contravened the institution constitution and compromised its probity, hence the call for its immediate dissolution. However, efforts to speak with the Vice Chancellor of the university, Professor Sanusi Mamman, on the allegation were futile as his three registered telephone lines were not connecting as of press time. But the university’s Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Dr. Murtala Abdullahi Kwara, has confirmed the allegation, and called for the suspension of the vice chancellor. He reiterated that there were about 17 different allegations ranging from misconduct and financial misappropriation against the vice chancellor of the university.
