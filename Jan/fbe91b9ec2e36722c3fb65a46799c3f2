Kebbi State Governor and Vice Chairman Food Security Council, Mr. Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, has said that the price of rice would soon stabilise in such a way that it would be favourable to both farmers and consumers in the country. Bagudu gave the assurance yesterday in Birnin Kebbi when he received the Chairman of WACOT Rice, Mr. Faruk Gumel, at the government house. He said current expansion of the firm from its initial installed capacity of 120,000 metric tonnes to 240,000 metric tonnes was an indication of the tremendous confidence it had in the economy of the Kebbi State and Nigeria particularly in rice production. He said: “This is a huge confidence in the policies of President Muhammadu Buhari that are aimed at bolstering rice production in the country.” The governor commended WACOT over what he called its myriad of social responsibility projects being executed to assist over 300 women rice producers in the state. He added that with the efforts so far displayed by WACOT more rice milling companies are following suit such as Labana, Dangote, Lolo rice mills and others. Speaking earlier, the Chairman of Wacot Rice, Mr. Faruk Gumel, said the visit was to update the governor on the ongoing expansion project of the rice company in Argungu area of the state. Gumel stated that the project would be completed within 15 to 18 months and the firm would recruit more workers to beef up its production capacity upon the completion of the project.
