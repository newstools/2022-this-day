Fidelis David Ondo State Governor, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has charged residents in the state, especially farmers, to report any invasion of farmlands and unauthorised grazing to the South West Security Network (Amotekun), the Police, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, and other security agencies, rather than resort to self-help. This is coming after three persons were shot dead last Thursday by suspected herdsmen who invaded Molege Village in Ose Local Goverment Area of Ondo State, while Several houses were set ablaze during the incident. The governor, who gave the warning yesterday said: “ This reinforced directive, which is the outcome of the State Security Council meeting is pertinent following renewed hostilities between farmers and herders resulting in casualties in some boundary towns between Ondo and Edo States. “Undoubtedly the latest killings are barbaric and condemnable even as efforts have been deepened to apprehend the culprits through inter-state co-operation and synergy. “Goverment however, believes strongly that such situations are avoidable if security agencies are always afforded the opportunity to intervene before the escalation of violence”. Akeredolu therefore, urged residents to abide by the directive and trust in the capacity of our security agencies to enforce to the fullest, provisions of the Anti-open Grazing Law that is in operation in the State. “Henceforth, any confirmed report of self-help that impairs the operations of security agencies shall be viewed as unhelpful to government’s efforts at any given instance,” Akeredolu added.
