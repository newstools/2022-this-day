There have been interesting developments that have been recorded across various industries in Africa over the last decade and Africans are at the forefront of the development. The technology entrepreneurship space, for instance, has witnessed incredible milestones with a handful of unicorn startups already available on the continent. While all these are laudable, there is the need to keep the momentum. Dozy Mmobuosi, the Founder and CEO of Tingo Inc. and Tingo International Holdings is intensifying its effort towards a better and more prosperous Africa for generations to come. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/761e2652-dozy-mmobuosi.jpeg?w=696&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Mmobuosi is doing this through his newly established Dozy Mmobuosi Foundation, a foundation founded with the sole purpose of addressing several key challenges on the continent. One of the core focuses of the foundation is the engagement of Africans and their leaders in better critical thinking practices which are of great importance for the future of the continent in the global community. The foundation will be partnering with the government at all levels including non-governmental organisations and educational institutions to achieve this. There will also be courses around critical thinking and entrepreneurship, which Mmobuosi believes, will be the framework for a highly-skilled, high performing, next-generation workforce and leadership which will pave the way for Africa to meet its true potential. Another of its initiatives is an innovative student loan for tertiary education for Africans. The initiative is targeted at Africans that can’t afford tertiary education and need financial assistance which they won’t pay back until after graduating from school. The loan, according to Mmobuosi, will be given to students at a 3% interest rate. He also confirmed that the repayment of the loan which is five years will only begin five years after taking the loan and it is during this period that the low interest would set it. “The aim is to provide fair and affordable student loans to Nigerian students in tertiary institutions across Nigeria,” Mmobuosi said. This is beyond the plan of the foundation to give education scholarships to deprived kids across Nigeria. The foundation will also be working with initiatives and programs that promote gender equality while also providing support to women in Africa, starting with Nigeria. During the launch of the foundation on January 1st, 2022, the foundation celebrated the festive period with children from low-income communities by taking festive parties to their doorstep, showering them with gifts. Other initiatives of the foundation include working with relevant institutions towards supporting vaccine production and distribution in Nigeria. Mmobuosi will also be providing grants to widows and smallholder farmers across the country, which is more of an extension of the work he has been doing with Nwassa, a dedicated digital agri-marketplace platform that is connecting African farmers with other players in the agricultural value chain.
