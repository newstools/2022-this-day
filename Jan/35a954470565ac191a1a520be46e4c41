On the 18 January, 2022 a delegation of the Naval Officers’ Wives Association, led by the National President Hajiya Nana Aisha Gambo, paid a visit to The First Lady of Sao Tome and Principe, Maria de Fátima Vila Nova at the presidential Villa in Sao Tome and Principe. The visit is targeted at initiating programmes to enhance the capacity and development of women in Africa. Speaking further on the visit, Hajiya Gambo added that, “The idea of the visit is to expose NOWA to women empowerment initiative as practiced by governments in other countries as well as share ideas on how to empower women throughout Africa.” The NOWA President was accompanied by the wife of the Ambassador of Nigeria to Sao Tome and Principe, Mrs. Rita Chiejina as well as other selected members of association. Since taking the office in 2021, Hajiya Gambo has relentlessly contributed immensely to the development and empowerment of women under NOWA. These she has successfully accomplished with several projects across the country that has helped hundreds of women be more self sufficient, better trained and ready to key into the work demands.
