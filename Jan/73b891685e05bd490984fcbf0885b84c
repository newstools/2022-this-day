Francis Sardauna The Katsina State Government has charged food vendors in the state to ensure the quality and hygiene of the food they sell to the public to avert the outbreak of communicable diseases in the state. The Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Dr. Mustapha Muhammed Inuwa, made the call on Tuesday when he received the leadership of Katsina Food Vendors Association in his office. He lamented that lack of qualitative food and personal hygiene by some food vendors has contributed significantly to the spread of communicable diseases in the state. He said: “50 per cent of the sickness being experienced today emanated from lack of food hygiene by some food vendors and this contributes to the spread of diseases. So, ensure personal hygiene.” While reiterating the state government’s support to members of the association, Inuwa called on them to monitor the activities of their members who sell food by the roadside to enhance hygiene. Earlier, the Chairman of the Association, Aminu Kabir, urged the state government to support members of the association by partronaging them in order to boost their commercial activities.
