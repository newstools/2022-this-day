According to analysts at Cordros capital, “In the near term, we believe positioning for 2021FY dividends will continue to support buying activities in the market even as institutional investors continue to search for clues on the direction of yields in the FI market.
“However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.”
Analysts also believe that the early passage of the 2022 budget would be positive for the stock market.
