Fidelis David in Akure The former Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, has denied any meeting to discuss a vice-presidential ambition with Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State as Nigeria gradually prepares for the 2023 election. In a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Digital and Media, John Paul Akinduro, the immediate past governor of the sunshine state said the permutations were all false and do not represent his interest and position on the political reality of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It was reported that Governor Tambuwal and Mimiko met in Abuja recently where the decision to pair up as presidential and vice presidential aspirants were muted. But Mimiko in the statement said no such meeting was held and so no such a proposal could have been considered. He said: “Dr Mimiko is aligned with the aspiration of the people of Southern Nigeria as exemplified by the call of the Southern Governors for a Southern president in the next dispensation and he has not in all his deliberations within Afenifere muted any idea of seeking their support for a VP ambition. “Above all, Mimiko has made it clear that he is in the PDP to work towards actualising the decision of the majority of party members towards rescuing and rebuilding Nigeria for the good of the people and not any personal, individual agenda,” the statement reads. The statement further asked: “Is it not curious that the Telegraph report, speculative in its entirety, neither quoted any source nor sought confirmation or denial of any of its specious conjectures before publishing?” Mimiko in conclusion asked Nigerians and PDP members in particular to disregard the report as it is false and conjectural.
