Deji Elumoye in Abuja The administration of President Muhammadu Buhari has bared its fang against the recurring incidents of security lapses in some parts of the country. For a start, it has ordered immediate major military operation in Niger State, which has faced continued attacks on its communities by bandits and remnants of Boko Haram terrorists fleeing theaters of war in the North-western and North-eastern parts of the country. Exercising his power as the Commander-in-Chief of the nation’s Armed Forces, President Buhari, according to a release on Sunday by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a directive to the Defence Headquarters a few days ago, asked the military to respond robustly to the cases of killings and kidnappings in the state and to give effect to the strategic objectives through the use of force. In his message to the Government and people of Niger State, the president said: “I would like to express sincere sympathies to the government and people of the state following recent security incidents.” He reiterated that security is a responsibility of every member of the community and only through solidarity and cooperation with law enforcement agencies can the problems be finally defeated. According to him, “The federal government is willing to strengthen support and cooperation with all the states. I believe that with the full cooperation of the citizens, we will surely overcome this problem.”
