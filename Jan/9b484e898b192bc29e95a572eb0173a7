Ghana’s Minister of Youth and Sports, Mustapha Ussif, has summoned the leadership of the Ghana Football Associationfor an emergency meeting scheduled for tomorrow, January 21, 2022 over the disgraceful exit of the Black Starsat the ongoing African Cup of Nations in Cameroon. In a statement issued by the ministry yesterday, Ussif said his ministry “is committed to taking steps to restore the Black Stars to the status of symbol of national pride of every Ghanaian and a powerhouse in African football.” The minister expressed disappointment over the performance of the Black stars and stated the Ministry would want to meet officials of the FA on Friday to discuss the way forward. “The entire country is extremely disappointed by the abysmal performance and early exit of the Black Stars from the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, and the Ministry of Youth and Sports shares in the nation’s sentiment. “With the government providing the team all the needed logistical and financial support, including resources for preparations and participation in the qualifier stage to the tournament and eventually a pre-tournament camping in Qatar, the ministry is particularly disappointed with the team’s performance,” stressed the statement from the ministry. The Black Stars were eliminated from the competition after they were defeated 3-2 by minnows Comoros and failed to win a single match at the group stage. Ghana’s elimination from the competition is the worst performance by the Senior National Team in the AFCON tournament in history. The majority of Ghanaians have called on the FA to immediately relieve the head coach of the team, Milovan Rajevac, over his poor performance.
