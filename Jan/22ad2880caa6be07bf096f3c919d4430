Adedayo Akinwale The Organised Private Sector for Osinbajo (OPS 4 Osinbajo) has said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was better intellectually equipped than any current presidential aspirant for the task of leading the country. The group’s spokesman, Mr. Abdulrahman Farouk, stated this on Monday in Abuja during a visit to The Progressive Project (TPP) office. The TPP, the umbrella group of all Osinbajo’s support groups, quoted Farouk in a statement yesterday as saying Osinbajo’s candidature offered much hope for citizens, who had high expectations about job creation, increased earnings and growth. He stated: “Even though an aspirant has informed Muhammadu Buhari about his 2023 ambition, the most credible option still appears to be Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and for the organised Private Sector as well as the citizenry, Osinbajo offers much fertile ground for hope to rapidly germinate. “With Osinbajo, Nigeria’s organised private sector, has much basis for optimism about post-2023 economic activities.” The group pointed out that rather than mere sentiments, Nigerians must carefully weigh the past and current potentials of various candidates towards using their voter’s card responsibly in the 2023 election. Farouk noted that the idealistic and patriotic pursuit of various economic policies led by Osinbajo spoke volumes about future potentials for people-focused policies, adding that under his supervision, Nigeria’s social investment programmes had been ranked internationally but much more good news would unfold when fully in the saddle by 2023.
