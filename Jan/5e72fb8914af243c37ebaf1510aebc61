Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja The federal government has restored the Tenure Policy under the 2021 edition of the Public Service Rules (PSR). The Head of Service of the Federation, Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan disclosed this at the meeting of the National Public Service Negotiating Councils in Abuja that was attended by FCT Minister of State, Dr Ramatu Aliyu and the President of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Ayuba Waba. In the revised PSR, a Director or its equivalent by whatever nomenclature shall compulsorily retire after serving eight years on the post. In the same vein, a Permanent Secretary shall hold office for a term of four years which is renewable for a further term of four years, subject to satisfactorily performance and no more. Also the annual leave of workers would be computed based on working days as opposed to calendar days as it was in the old PSR. The Head of Service disclosed that although government was considering a salary review, workers must sit up and do the work expected of them. She decried the state of civil service which she said had over the years become a dumping ground for all sorts of persons. She urged the union to root out charlatans from the system, noting that many workers were fond of loitering about in the offices without doing anything commensurate with their pay. “This government is ready to increase our salary. I hope when we invite the union we must able to come to good. There is no government that can rise above the quality of itself. If we have allowed charlatans in, we must look for a way of getting them out so that we can rescue ourselves. “After this meeting I will invite the union to also come and sit down with us and think of a way of rescuing the service back. What you have now is not a service. We must agree on that,” she said. She also urged workers to attend training, saying it would reflect on performance evaluation.
