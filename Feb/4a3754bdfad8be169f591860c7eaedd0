George Okoh in Makurdi Benue State Government has announced that henceforth, all operators of illegal revenue collection checkpoints in the state will be treated like armed robbers when apprehended. The state Governor, Samuel Ortom, said those indulging in such acts should steer clear of revenue collection in the state. The governor gave the warning yesterday at the Benue Peoples House in Makurdi while signing into law the amended Internal Revenue Administration Law of the state. He explained that revenue collection in the state had been contracted to consultants, and urged interested persons to work with them, stressing that anyone caught operating illegally will be treated like a criminal. Ortom admitted the decline in revenue generation and the need to improve on all areas to be able to cater for the needs of the state. The governor thanked members of the state House of Assembly for the speedy passage of the amendment, and pledged sustained cordial working relationship between the executive and the legislature. The Deputy Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon Christopher Adaji, who represented the Speaker of the Assembly, said the amendments were done after due consultations with critical stakeholders and relevant provisions of the law.
