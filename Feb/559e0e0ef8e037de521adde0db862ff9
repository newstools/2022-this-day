Former Governor of Jigawa state Alhaji Sule Lamido has decried the institutional decay in the country’s educational system and called for an overhaul to ensure quality products from educational institutions across the nation. A statement signed by BIKOBA National Publicity Secretary, Mahmud Ibrahim Kwari, said, Lamido said poor quality content on the part of graduates produced by the primary, secondary and tertiary institutions justified the need for a review of the curriculum of Nigeria’s educational system. He noted that the enormous challenges facing the nation require capable and competent professionals and other graduates with patriotic mindset trained in “our educational institutions of learning at all levels.”
The former foreign affairs minister stated this while receiving members of National exco of Birninkudu Old Boys Association (BIKOBA) led by its President, Alhaji Ja’afar Usman Muhammad (Turakin Gaya) at his office in Kano. Alhaji Sule Lamido who graduated from the then Birninkudu Senior Primary School (now Government Unity College Birninkudu, Jigawa state) in 1961 before he proceeded to the famous Government College, Zaria (now Barewa College) in 1962 said ‘’governments at all levels must continuously invest heavily in education to enable our Primary Schools, Colleges, Polytechnics, Universities and other education related institutions of learning produce the needed quality graduands with required skills and technical competence, so that they can effectively and efficiently contribute their quarter towards nation building in accordance with our current needs’’. He noted that, it’s common knowledge that, for some time now, Nigeria had been in trying times, and was in dire need of critical thinkers with total commitment, so that, the moral decadence and patriotic deficit among the citizens could be restored. The former governor who challenged the entire members of BIKOBA, especially those holding exalted positions within and outside the country to pay back what was given to them by the school, noted that, the College was the root and basis of their current positions based on the education and knowledge obtained therefrom and should not in anyway allow it to collapse. Speaking earlier, the BIKOBA President, Alhaji Ja’afar Usman Muhammad (Turakin Gaya) who appreciated the former governor over his continuous support to his Alma Mata, said the purpose of the visit was to formally intimate him about the state of the Association, introduce new exco members and solicit for his guidance to reconnect with other notable members of the Association with a view to making the college better. Government Unity College Birninkudu was transformed to a conducive environment for effective teaching and learning activities during Lamido’s administration in Jigawa state.
