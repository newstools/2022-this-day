Deji Elumoye in Abuja Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has disclosed that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has agreed on a zoning formula that will swap offices held between north and south. By this arrangement, all offices that were occupied by northerners in the last eight years will go to the south and vice versa. El-Rufai, who spoke with newsmen Tuesday after a meeting between President Muhammadu Buhari and the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) at the State House, Abuja, revealed that a working agreement had been reached by the party on zoning formula. His words: “We have agreed a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones. Essentially, northern zone will have the positions the south have had in the last eight years, and vice versa. “It is a very simple, equitable and fair formula. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation will start in earnest. “So, by the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention.” Details later…
