* Says NGO lacks powers to institute case Alex Enumah Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja on Monday struck out a suit challenging the Nigerian citizenship of presidential aspirant and former Vice-President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Justice Ekwo struck out the suit brought by the Incorporated Trustees of Egalitarian Mission for Africa, on the grounds that the plaintiff being a non-governmental organization (NGO) has no legal right to commence such proceedings against Atiku. According to the court, the NGO having been registered under Company and Allied Matters Act with special functions cannot jump into public interest litigation that was not part of its objective. Justice Ekwo held that NGO’s should refrain from filing frivolous applications targeted at harrassing politically exposed Nigerians. In the suit, the group had asked the court to disqualify Atiku as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and to restrain him from contesting the February 16, 2019 presidential election over alleged circumstances surrounding his citizenship. The suit, which was filed on February 11, 2019, had Atiku, PDP, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, as well as the Attorney General of Adamawa State as defendants. Specifically, the plaintiff had approached the court for an interpretation of Sections 25(1) & (2) and 131(a) of the 1999 Constitution. By the suit, the plaintiff prayed for “A declaration that by the combined interpretation of Sections 25(l) & (2) and 131(a) of the Constitution and given the circumstances surrounding Atiku’s birth, he cannot be cleared by PDP and INEC to contest for post of president”.
