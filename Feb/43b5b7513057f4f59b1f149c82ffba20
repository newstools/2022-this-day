Former Cameroon star Roger Milla believes current captain Vincent Aboubakar could become one of Africa’s greatest ever players. The 30-year-old has scored six times at this year’s Africa Cup of Nations finals, which is the best tally by any player since 1998 – when Benni McCarthy (South Africa) and Hossam Hassan (Egypt) got seven apiece. Saudi Arabia-based Aboubakar netted Cameroon’s winner against Egypt in the 2017 finaland will lead the Indomitable Lions into Thursday’s semi-final against the North Africans. The all-time top goalscorer at a single Nations Cup is Ndaye Mulamba,who struck nine times for eventual champions Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1974. “Aboubakar could be one of the greatest African footballers,” Milla told BBC Sport African yesterday. “Unfortunately, two years ago he suffered a very serious injury which sidelined him for four months. “I’m very happy for him because he came into AFCON in good form. When he’s playing, it’s as if the whole country wants to make up for lost time and they want him to win. “I hope he gets a goal against Egypt – and why not in the final?”
