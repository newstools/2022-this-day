Deji Elumoye in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday signed into law the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill transmitted to him by the National Assembly on January 31 with a call on the legislative arm to delete Section 84(12) of the Act which bars political office holders from participating in their parties’ primaries.
Speaking shortly before assenting his signature at a brief ceremony at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja witnessed by the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila; Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha and Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, among other top government officials, President Buhari said the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022, passed by the National Assembly, holds a lot of promise for improving the election processes in the country, with introduction of new technology, and efforts to engender clarity and transparency.
He, however, stressed the need to amend section 84(12), which contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote, or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.
His words: “Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, from the review it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.
“This, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.
“Section 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the National Election,’’ he said.
