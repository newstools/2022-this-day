Yinka Kolawole A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Lekan Ojo, has cautioned former Governor of Osun State, Rauf Aregbesola, and the incumbent state Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, not to lead the state into a battle field for criminals the sake of development of the state. The party stakeholder, who spoke with THISDAY in Osogbo yesterday, noted that Aregbesola seems to be powerful in the state but the incumbent state governor must endeavour to endure till the end of his second term. Ojo, who is also a security expert, contended that if the crisis persists, it would lead to the end of APC as a party in the state, adding that Aregbesola and Oyetola are like two parallel lines now that can never meet. According to him “Somebody who is your boy today could be your leader tomorrow.” Ojo equally stressed that the primary would determine the faith of the party and it would help to make or mar the political party in the state. The politician said there were disgruntled elements within the party, but cautioned all dissident in the APC to allow peace to reign in the state. He cautioned that Osun people are not at war, therefore, those that are loyal to Aregbesola and Oyetola should be magnanimous in victory. Ojo, however, noted that since the party was already polarised, it would be a big risk for APC if care was not taken.
