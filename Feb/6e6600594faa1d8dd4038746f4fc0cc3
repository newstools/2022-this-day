According to him, “All the real and perceived problems within the PDP in the state are not beyond amicable resolution, and I commend our elders and leaders for their meaningful mediation which is already yielding fruitful results “I consider our problem or our matter as local and domestic, which can and will be resolved domestically. Therefore, let us be civil, couth, and display maturity in the use of words “Beyond politics, let us see and embrace ourselves as brothers and sisters in dealing with one another in order to collectively build a virile PDP capable of winning all the elections resoundingly. “We need to be diplomatic, strategic, calm, calculating, methodical and decent in our approach to the conduct of free and fair primaries.” The lawmaker also pointed out that Makinde did not declare his support for anyone of the PDP aspirants in the state as being alleged be a group of the party members in the state, saying: “He is a credible leader whose concern is basically for the victory of the party in all the elections.”
