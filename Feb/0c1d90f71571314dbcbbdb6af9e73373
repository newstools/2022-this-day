The 2022 Champions League final will be played in Paris after Russia was stripped of the match following the nation’s invasion of Ukraine. The final of Europe’s most prestigious club competition was due to be played in St Petersburg on 28 May. Uefa said the match would not be held at the Gazprom Arena and would move to the Stade de France in Paris instead. Meanwhile, Russia’s Formula 1 Grand Prix, due to take place in Sochi in September, has been cancelled. F1 says it is “impossible” to hold the event in “the current circumstances”. (BBC)
