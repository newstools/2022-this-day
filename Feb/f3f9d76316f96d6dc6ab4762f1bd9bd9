LA LIGA Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang scored twice as Barcelona ran riot at Mestalla to beat Valencia 4-1 and climb back into LaLiga’s top four yesterday. Aubameyang’s double came either side of a Frenkie de Jong tap-in as a free-flowing Barca hit Valencia with three goals in 15 minutes towards the end of the first half. And while Valencia briefly raised hopes of a comeback when Carlos Soler headed in Bryan Gil’s cross after halftime, a stunning strike from Pedri, which skimmed off Aubameyang’s back, completed Barcelona’s impressive victory.

Victory lifts Barca above Atletico Madrid on goal difference, despite Atletico’s win at Osasuna on Saturday.

The second was more intricate, a superb team goal going through Sergio Busquets and Alba before Ousmane Dembele generously side-footed across for De Jong to finish. Dembele was key to the third too, as his through ball released Gavi, who crossed to the back post where Aubameyang tapped in No 3. Valencia thought they had a goal back before halftime through Soler’s acrobatic finish but it was ruled out when replays showed the ball had rolled out for what should have been a throw-in during the build-up. Soler, though, scored again shortly after the restart, heading
