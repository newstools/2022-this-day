Paradigm Initiative is joining stakeholders within the digital sphere to empower individuals and businesses to respect and safeguard the privacy of online users. Stressing that digital rights are human rights, Paradigm Initiative called on stakeholders, policymakers, governments, academia, businesses, and the general public to be intentional in sensitising the masses and cautiously considering measures to ensure that the right to privacy is given due consideration in the way data is collected and stored. Paradigm Initiative said it would persist in its efforts to monitor and support the rightful use of data collection, and its protection. “We have also kept a watchful eye on the policy landscape of data protection in Africa as well the authorities in charge of this mandate. We have drafted several policy briefs, carried out workshops and research to best evaluate data protection situations in Africa, as well as developed several tools to help curb the malaise within the continent. “Some of our recent publications include the DPA report that maps out the state of data protection legislation and authorities in Africa, Assessing Data Protection in Nigeria and Towards a Data Protection Legislative Framework in Nigeria, which highlights the impact and effectiveness of the Nigerian data protection regulatory framework across different thematic areas, and Nigeria’s legislative and regulatory journey towards enacting comprehensive data protection legislation. These reports offer some great conclusions and recommendations to ease data protection and privacy,” Paradigm Initiative said in a statement. CEO, Paradigm Initiative, Mr. Gbenga Sesan, said its tools of impact such as ripoti.africa, a platform that enables online users to report digital rights violations in Africa including breaches of online privacy, and ayeta.africa, a proactive toolkit for African digital rights actors, are all aimed at addressing the growing need to safeguard digital rights defenders, journalists , whistleblowers, and others working with sensitive information in the global South.
