Gideon Arinze in Enugu Despite calls for the cancellation of the Enugu State local government elections by the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over alleged exclusion of the party, the exercise kicked off as scheduled across local government areas in the state. Members of the party had last Tuesday gathered at the office of the state Independent Electoral Commission (ENSIEC) to protest “the refusal by the commission to publish a list of 260 councilors and 17 chairmanship candidates forwarded to the electoral body in December 2021.” The state Chairman of the APC, Ugochukwu Agballah, had declared that the party would void the election should the ENSIEC go ahead to hold the exercise, alleging that the ENSIEC decided to publish the list submitted by Ben Nwoye, a former suspended caretaker chairman of the APC.
