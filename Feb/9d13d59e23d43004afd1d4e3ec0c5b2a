Peter Uzoho Stakeholders in the oil and gas industry from within and outside Nigeria will converge on Abuja later this month for the third edition of the Nigerian International Energy Summit (NIES) to brainstorm on the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA)’s implementation and the future of the industry. The theme of the energy summit slated for February 27 to March 3, 2022, is, “Revitalising the Industry: Future Fuels and Energy Transition.”
The event producer, Brevity Anderson, said the session on the PIA would witness an intense and heated debate by industry professionals, policy makers and stakeholders in attendance. Managing Director of Brevity Anderson, Mr. James Shindi, said the biggest issue in Nigeria’s energy sector over the last 20 years is the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) that metamorphosed into the PIA. Shindi said industry stakeholders are now saddled with the implementation of the PIA, adding that the NIES platform would provide that stage for thorough scrutiny of the Act and the journey so far with the implementation. He said, “There is no doubt that the biggest issue in Nigeria’s energy sector over the last 20 years was the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB). Several unsuccessful attempts were made to push it past the finish line until last year that it became an Act. “It is a major feat by the Buhari presidency. It is a landmark. It is a historic development and it is a phenomenon. “What we are saddled with right now is its implementation and you be rest assured that the NIES platform will provide that stage for thorough scrutiny of the PIA and the journey so far with its implementation.”
