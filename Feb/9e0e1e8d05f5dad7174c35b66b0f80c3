Deji Elumoye in Abuja Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno state has warned that the Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) can overrun Nigeria if its activities are left unchecked.
The governor made the declaration Thursday while featuring at the weekly media briefing organized by the Presidential Communication Team at the State House; Abuja.
