This week, analysts at United Capital Plc expected to see investors continue to book profits on positions that have appreciated significantly in the past weeks. “From the large cap stocks, we expecting the profit-taking to extend to their mid-cap and small-cap out-performers. That said, with the big banks likely to release their full year, 2021 numbers within the next two weeks, we expect investors to begin to take positions in names expected to deliver outperforming numbers while declaring strong dividend payments,” it stated.
