Seriki Adinoyi in Jos Palpable tension gripped Plateau State yesterday following the news of the abduction of another traditional ruler in Mangu Local Government Area of the state, Dikyet Gupiya from his residence in Pushit by unknown armed men. =The victim is the District Head of Pushit, the hometown of the State Deputy Governor, Professor Sonni Tyoden, and a close relative of the deputy governor. A source in the village, Mr. Joshua Dazyem said, “He was kidnapped on Thursday night at about 10 minutes past 9p.m. right from his palace where he was watching NTA network news. He has been taken to an unknown destination. We are now praying for his safe release.” He said the gunmen numbering about 10, and armed with rifles and other weapons invaded the palace and took him with them.
He said that the kidnappers are yet to get in touch with the palace or relations of the monarch since his abduction. The State Police Command has confirmed the incident as the Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Gabriel Uba said, “Yes, we are aware that a third class chief was kidnapped somewhere in Mangu.
