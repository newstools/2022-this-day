Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, has directed the immediate delivery of food and non-food items to victims of the Muna El-Badawy Internally Displaced Persons(IDP) camp in Maiduguri. The directive followed a fire incident on Saturday that razed over 3,000 shelters in the camp and rendered many households homeless. The minister sympathised with the government and people of Borno state over the fire incident that led to loss of lives and destruction of shelters. “This disaster has rendered many more people without shelter even as government intensifies efforts to re-settle Internally Displaced Persons. “The spate of fire incidents in IDP camps has become recurrent and the ministry is putting up measures to educate the IDPs on ways of preventing such fire disasters,” she said. The fire, which reportedly started from a tent, engulfed 3,000 others due to the absence of fire fighting facilities. The National Emergency Management Agency NEMA and the SEMA have already begun an on-the-field assessment of the damage. As part of relief effort, the ministry of humanitarian affairs has since directed that the affected IDPs be provided with food, water and grains as well as non food items like clothing, blankets, mosquito nets and other items to temporarily mitigate the hardship in camp as a result of the fire incident.
