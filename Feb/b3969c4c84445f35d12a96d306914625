Society Watch Oil mogul and philanthropist, Prince Arthur Eze, has a strong belief in the witty saying that “in giving, we receive.” He always gives, and the returns on his ‘social investment’ continue to triple in many folds. But beyond his famed philanthropy, he is someone who does not tolerate any act of indiscipline. He is ready to give out anything for humanity, but will never allow you to steal from his sweats without fighting back. This scenario played out recently when the oil mogul fought tooth and nail to recover what was stolen from him by two of his nephews, Olisaebuka Okechukwu Eze and Onyeka Nnadozie Eze, the Administrative and Finance Managers respectively, who were accused of criminal breach of trust and diversion of funds to the tune over N1 billion belonging to the firm. Consequently, he petitioned the EFCC; and at the end of the trial that lasted about two years, the businessman won.
The anti-graft agency, in the course of the investigation, initiated forfeiture proceedings against the two company officials before Justice I. M. Buba of the Federal High Court, Enugu, which granted an interim order of forfeiture of the said properties, directing the defendants to show cause why the properties should not be finally forfeited. In the absence of any contrary information, the court on October 18, 2021, ordered that the properties be finally forfeited and returned to the nominal complainant, Eze. An elated Eze could not hide his joy when he visited the Enugu office of EFCC on January 28, 2022. The Zonal Commander, EFCC Enugu, Oshodi Johnson, who received him, commended the investigative and prosecution teams as well as the judiciary for ensuring that justice was served in the case.
