These resolutions followed the adoption of a motion on the need to Investigate the Incidences of Fake Insurance Certificates in Nigeria, which was moveby Hon. Oluyemi Adewale Taiwo, at plenary yesterday. Presenting the motion, Taiwo noted that the Insurance Act, 2003 mandated all motorists to have a minimum of Third-Party Motor Insurance Policy in place and that Section 68 of Act stipulates that “no person shall use or cause or permit any other person to use a motor vehicle on a road unless a liability, which he may thereby incur in respect of damage to the property of third- party is insured with an insurer registered under this act.” He explained that the statutory laws of the country stipulated that no motorist should ply Nigeria roads without having a genuine Insurance certificate, however, most motorists have continued to show absolute disregard for this statutory requirement. “The number of vehicles with fake certificates on Nigeria road has risen to 9.4 million and the figure released by the Nigeria Insurers Association revealed that only 2.72 million vehicles on Nigeria roads have valid insurance covers as of February 2021. “Millions of vehicles, trucks and motorcycles plying Nigeria roads are not insured, “he added.
