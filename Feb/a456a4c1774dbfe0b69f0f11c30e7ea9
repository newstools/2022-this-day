Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt The Nigerian Army has stated its readiness to partner the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) and other relevant institutions and agencies of government to end illegal oil bunkering in the Niger Delta region. The General Officer Commanding of the 6 Division, Major General Olufemi Oluyede, made the commitment yesterday when he received PAP’s Interim Administrator, Col. Milland Dixon Dikio (rtd), in his office in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The army chief, who identified some of the perpetrators of the illegal oil bunkering as ex-agitators, said they were ignorant of the level of harm they were causing the environment. Oluyede commended Dikio for making Amnesty programme a successful platform to sustain the peace in the region. He said: “We commend you on the remarkable success you have recorded since your appointment and urge you to continue. We also want you to intervene in the issue of illegal oil bunkering.” In his remarks, Dikio promised to intensify awareness on illegal oil bunkering, describing it as a detrimental contributor to the health of the people. He said: “We are creating more awareness on the issue. Recently, some of our delegates and ex-agitators held a sensitisation workshop in Port Harcourt as part of our efforts to end illegal oil bunkering. “Let me state that anyone involved in ‘kpofire’ is like a murderer. They’ve made the atmosphere in and around Port Harcourt a health hazard. That is how bad it is.” Dikio urged persons involved in illegal bunkering to redirect their energy into palm oil business. He said: “Rather than engage in kpofire business, which endanges the health of the people in the region and in addition destroy our environment and eco system, it is better to go into palm oil production.”
