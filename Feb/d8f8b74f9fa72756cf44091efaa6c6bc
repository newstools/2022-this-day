According to a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo said: “For faith-based organisations, it is an article of faith that you must contribute to the development of society.” The Vice President urged faith-based organisations to speak more for the unity of the country and peaceful coexistence among Nigerians. “I appreciate the social service works that the church (i.e The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) is doing in the area of clean water, immunization, and several other things. For faith-based organisations, it is an article of faith that you must contribute to the development of society. “We need to also speak a bit more about the unity of men and women across the country regardless of their faith and ethnicity. We are at a time in our country where this message is very important. The message of unity, the message of saying that nations are built around people who believe in God and those who do not.” On his part, Elder Christofferson, who was accompanied by his wife and other church leaders and their spouses from within and outside Nigeria, commended the efforts of the Vice President in fostering unity and peaceful coexistence among Nigerians and noted that the church in Nigeria would continue to contribute to the growth and development aside preaching unity among citizens.
