Victor Osimhen has received a new and lighter protective mask as his recovery is going even better than first hoped. The Napoli striker found the first mask he wore after surgery for facial fractures irritating and that it affected his vision. Today he had a check-up with surgeon Gianpaolo Tartaro, who performed the original operation, and a lighter mask was created. “We have already begun to reduce the protective mask, which he will wear from this weekend’s game with Venezia,” Tartaro toldRadio Kiss Kiss. “The mask is certainly causing him some difficulties, but it’s the only thing allowing him to play. He will certainly wear it until the end of February, then after more tests we’ll decide if he can take it off or continue to wear it in March. “Osimhen no longer has scarring or swelling, his biological response to the fractures is better than expected. Every time, he manages to recover quicker than we thought.”
