Society Watch Otunba Funsho Lawal, Chairman of Sogenal Petroleum, is one of the few businessmen in the country whose names open doors wherever they go. He is popular, rich and well-connected. In fact, his presence always enlivens any social function he attends. But for some time now, he has not been in the news. His reason for keeping a low profile, it was gathered, is for strategic reasons. It was further gathered that he is planning something big that will redefine the sector and change its narratives. The genial billionaire businessman, who is also the Maaye of Ogbomosho, has earned a name for himself through his contributions to the nation’s oil and gas sector. The two-term President of The Petroleum Club and his team have worked and are still working on their vision to make his company a top-of-the-mind brand. As a result, they have altered the equation in Nigeria, through innovation, experience and quality corporate culture. Apart from being born under the proverbial lucky star, Lawal, a former Chairman of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), has also demonstrated uncommon bravery and doggedness. A philanthropist of repute, he is passionate about lifting the struggling souls around him, without any pecuniary motive.
