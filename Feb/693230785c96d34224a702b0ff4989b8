Leicester City’s only realistic chance of qualifying for Europe next season is through the UEFA Europa Conference League The Leicester City trio of Kelechi Iheanacho, Wilfred Ndidi, and Ademola Lookman have been drawn against Ligue 1 side Rennes in the Round-of-16 of the UEFA Europa Conference League competition. Leicester City booked their place in the last-16 of UEFA’s newest competition with a 7-2 aggregate win over Danish side Randers FC. The UEFA Europa Conference League Round-of-16 fixtures will be a two-legged, home-and-away tie with the first legs to be played on Thursday, March 10 with the second leg on Thursday, March 17. Meanwhile, the Foxes are set to open contract talks with Ndidi and are set to reward the midfield linchpin with a lucrative contract. When fit, the 25-year-old is effectively undroppable at Leicester; not to mention being in and around the apex of top European footballers with regards to statistics. There is also an element to Ndidi’s character which is vital to LCFC: he is an affable, likeable guy. And as such, the former Genk man is needed for squad balance. That is not to say the jovial midfielder is unfocused. Astoundingly, the millionaire athlete is studying for a degree in business.
