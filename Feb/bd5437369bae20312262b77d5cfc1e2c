The company to be back on course for a rebound from profit drop last year but cost of sales pose a threat.
Despite a rise and fall pattern the company has remained profitable since it returned to profit in 2017 from a N563 million loss in 2016. With moderated input cost, Cadbury Nigeria’s gross profit rebounded at the end of September from a 34 per cent drop at half year to over six per cent improvement year-on-year to N5.6 billion. This is also a change of direction from a drop of 29 per cent in gross profit recorded at the end of 2020.
Cadbury Nigeria’s management needed to address fundamental imbalance in the company’s cost-income structure at half year when gross profit was insufficient to meet selling and distribution expenses.

This is logical as Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) profit margins are usually rather slim, hence Cadbury, like every other player operating in the FMCG sector mostly employs a strategy focused on driving top-line sales (revenue) and by extension increasing market share.
Consequently, the impact of the COVID-19 on the Company’s sales pressured revenue in 2020, and this impacted profits significantly.
