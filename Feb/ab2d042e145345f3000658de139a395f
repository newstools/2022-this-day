David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The Catholic Bishop of Awka Diocese in Anambra State, Most Rev Paulinus Ezeokafor, has warned youths against getting involved in money rituals and internet scams. The clergyman admonished that life was a gradual process and that young people should not have the mindset that they can wake up one morning and attain wealth. Bishop Ezeokafor gave the admonition at St. Mark’s Catholic Church, Abagana in Njikoka Local Government Area of the state where he inaugurated Regina Nwankwu Catholic Youth Organisation of Nigeria (CYON) Skills Acquisition Centre. He implored youths to shun unbridled quest for materialism and embrace hard work, honest labour as well as patience, even as he described life as a gradual process. He told the youths that: “Life grows gradually and everything grows gradually. People who made it in life did not rush it. If you rush it, you crash. When you crash it is always very devastating. You grow gradually. What is needed is consistency in trying to make genuine effort. “We thank those who provided the skills acquisition centre. We are happy. I believe that our young people should emulate outstanding role models and avoid Yahooism, Mkpurummiri and the rest. Let us learn to follow a humble beginning and climb gradually,” Bishop Ezeokafor charged. He expressed deep concern over what he described as a mad rush for quick wealth by the youths. The Bishop said that the current wave of money rituals, internet fraud and other atrocious acts being witnessed today calls for serious worry. “All we hear every day is ritual killings all over Nigeria. Young people should take life easy; they should understand that Rome was not built in a day. Slow and steady wins the race. Hard work pays. There’s no gain in money ritual,” he said. The Catholic Prelate emphasised that the idea of hurrying to become something overnight will never help, warning against the consequences of forcing nature and toeing such a path.
