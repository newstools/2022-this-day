The mold of pageantry in Nigeria is changing. In the past, it is easy to identify the handful of platforms but now we have competitors pushing the boundaries higher. One of the most-promising right now is Miss Olamma Africa Pageant organised by Emvirtue Network. Recall that in season 1 of the pageant, they had DStv and GOtv as official media partner, airing the pre-event campaign on six Africa Magic Channels, which resulted in a record 1208 registered contestants from over 5 African countries. According to the founder and CEO Miss Olamma Africa Pageant, Ogbuefi Emmanuel Ezima, Season 2 of the show would be a huge leap forward building from the success of Season 1. He said the plan is to deploy strategies involving huge media platforms such as CNN, BBC Africa, and other terrestrial TV stations like Arise TV, Channels, AIT, and TVC, to push the event. This is what makes, in essence, the toga ‘the biggest Pan-Igbo Pageant in the world’ true. He said further that Miss Olamma Africa season 2 would also make history as the first pageant to give a car each to the winner and first runner-up, then millions shared in cash prize across different category of winners. This milestone according to Ogbuefi is designed to restore confidence in the industry and make it attractive and competitive. He said the pageant is strictly for Igbo ladies between the ages of 18-28 who are resident in Nigeria and anywhere in the world. “This specificity is also to help promote the Igbo culture, excellence and enterprise; and also, to show the socio-economic potential, tourism, and beauty of the region and its people,” said Ezima.
