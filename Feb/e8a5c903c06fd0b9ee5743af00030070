David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has reacted to claims by the former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha that while he was governor he was able to contain the activities of the group. Spokesperson of the proscribed group, Mr. Emma Powerful, in a press release said the claims by Okorocha are laughable, disgraceful and unguarded, adding that his tenure as governor in the state is better forgotten. Powerful said: “Okorocha tried everything he could as governor of Imo State to stop IPOB in Imo State which he failed and now he has started dancing as a mad man by including IPOB in his infamous statement he was using to deceive the gullible minds in the state thinking he can be allowed to use IPOB for political gains.” The group warned the lawmaker and presidential hopeful to desist from dragging its name into politics, or be prepared to face them. “Okorocha was one of the most unfortunate things that have happened to Imo State. His infamous administration as Imo governor is better forgotten. Nigerians know him for whom he is: a hypocrite and selfish political fraudster. He should not play his evil politics close to IPOB. The group said: “Okorocha collected many lands belonging to the people of Imo State by force, converted same into his personal property because he was running Imo State as a private estate. “His atrocities in Imo State are pursuing him and his families including his son in-law Uche Nwosu because he could not advise his father in-law to allow people their ancestral lands and homes. These will continue to hunt them till eternity.” “Okorocha arrested our women in Imo State thinking he can break the spirit of IPOB followers. The present administration in Imo State collected people’s lands he took from them by force and handed back to the owners since then Okorocha hasn’t been himself. He started sponsoring unknown gunmen and cannibalism in the entire region but we will soon expose him,” the group alleged.
