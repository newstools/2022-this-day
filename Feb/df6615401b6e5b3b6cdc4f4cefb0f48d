Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia The Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule, yesterday restated the adoption of Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura as the only recognised candidate for the position of the national chairmanship position of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Sule made this known in a chat with journalists shortly after meeting with Al-Makura in Abuja. Responding to questions from journalists seeking clarification, especially that Senator Abdullahi Adamu has also joined the race for the national chairmanship of the APC, the governor said as a Nigerian, Adamu has the right to contest for the position, but the party in Nasarawa State has adopted Al-Makura. According to the governor, “Senator Al-Makura represented the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), leading to the merger of the legacy parties in 2013 which gave rise to the APC. If there is any face of the CPC in Nigeria, apart from President Muhammadu Buhari, it’s Tanko Al-Makura.” He emphasised that Adamu has the right to contest in a democracy, but the APC in Nasarawa State has endorsed Al-Makura. “Senator Adamu is a Nigerian. He is a member of the APC. But as a state, we have endorsed Al-Makura,”Sule insisted.
