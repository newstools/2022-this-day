Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) took the lion’s share of Nigeria’s hydrocarbons output between March 2020 and March 2021, with the country pumping a total of 665 million barrels of crude for the period, latest data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), has shown. Releasing the details of its activities for August 2021, the national oil company noted that of the entire barrels drilled for the period, PSC contracts yielded 264 million barrels in the period under review. Nigeria produces its oil through various arrangements, including through Joint Ventures (JVs), PSCs, Alternative Funding (AF), through the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a subsidiary of the NNPC and through Independent/Marginal Fields. PSCs are a contractual arrangement for exploration and production of petroleum resources where the contractor undertakes all the financial, technical and operational risks associated with petroleum operation in return for a share of profit oil after payment of royalty, cost and tax oil. The arrangement became effective on January 1, 1993, after it was considered that certain incentives were necessary to encourage activities in the deep offshore which requires significant investment and technology.
But although a period marked by the virulent Covid-19 pandemic, the daily average production per day for the period spanning March 2020 to March 2021, stood at 1.68 million compared to the current situation where the country is struggling to meet its quota of world oil production. Aside the PSC, according to the NNPC data, JVs produced 210 million barrels for the period under review, while under AF, 70.6 million barrels were produced while the NPDC as well as the independent and marginal fields produced 67.6 million and 52.6 million barrels respectively. According to the data, in March 2021, a total of $1.23 million barrels of crude oil & condensate were produced, representing an average daily production of 1.65 million barrels. This translated to an increase of 12.94 per cent of production compared to February 2021 performance. Of the March 2021 production, the NNPC document detailing its operations for the period ending in August, stated that JVs and PSCs contributed about 30.58 per cent and 41.70 per cent respectively. In the same vein, AF, NPDC and independents accounted for 9.95 per cent, nine per cent and 8.77 per cent respectively. “The NPDC March 2020 to March 2021 cumulative production from all fields totalled 67,612,393 barrels of crude oil translating to an average daily production of 170,738 barrels per day. “Comparing NPDC performance to national production, the company’s production share is 10.16 per cent. NPDC is projected to ramp-up production level to 250,000 bpd in the near future.
“From March 2020 to March 2021, a total volume of 672 million barrels of crude oil and condensate was lifted by all parties,” the national oil company stated. In addition, production from NPDC wholly operated assets amounted to 27.6 million barrels, or 40.89 per cent of the total NPDC production, with Okono Okpoho (OML 119) alone producing 18.43 per cent of the company’s operated assets and 7.54 per cent of the total NPDC production.
Also, on the NPDC operated JV assets, in which NPDC owns 55 per cent controlling interest, crude oil production amounted to 28.15 barrels (or 41.64 per cent of the NPDC total production). Of the 14.34 million barrels lifted on the account of NNPC in March 2021, 7.55 million barrels and 68 million barrels were for domestic and export markets respectively. At an average oil price of $64.48/barrel and exchange rate of 381/$ at the time, the domestic crude oil lifted by NNPC was valued at $487 million or a Naira equivalent of N185.559 for the month of March 2021.
On national gas production for the period April 2020 to April 2021, a total of 2,902.52 BCF of gas was produced, representing an average daily production of 7,369.76 mmscfd during the period. Period-to-date (April 2020 to April 2021), production from JVs, PSCs and NPDC contributed about 62.07 per cent, 19.95 per cent and 17.98 per cent of gas respectively to the total national gas production.
Nigeria managed to pump 1.399 million bpd out of the total allocation of 1.701 million in January, its best production figure in months.
