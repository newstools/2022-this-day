The 2021-22 season of the Edo Cricket League has moved into crucial stage as the top four teams are set for Super Four this weekend February 12and 13 at Edo Boys High School in Benin City. The four teams battling for the Seasons honour include defending champions of the U17 Cricket Club league who currently are topping the table, Ambrose Alli University (AAU) Cricket Club. The others are No Limit that parades national team bowling sensations, Victor Ipoli and Chiemelie Udekwe and Dolphins that parades Isesele brothers (Odion and Akere) both current national team players. Vice President of the Edo State Cricket Association, Barrister Abraham Oviawe said that this season has proven to be the best and most competitive season so far. “ The high presence of national team players at all levels make Edo Cricket League the toughest in the country. And of course this year too we have had many skilled players from other parts of the country. “This weekend’s Super Four is a watershed moment for us as we hope to have new talents prove themselves. All the four teams in the event are capable of winning and we are glad at the support offered by the Edo State Sports Council, the parents and different schools that allowed the students to participate actively in the league this season,” he said. The Super Four is a knock out league to determine the top four players as the league rounds off. Under-17 CC will be opening their account with an encounter with No Limit Cricket Club, while Dolphins will be taking on AAU CC in the second match of the opening day. The winners of each of matches (Semi-finals) will slug it out for the league title on Sunday February 13.
