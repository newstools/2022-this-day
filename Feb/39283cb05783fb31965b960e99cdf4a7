Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, Mr. Vitalis Oshokene, yesterday called on the former National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, to vie for the Edo North Senatorial seat in 2023 general election. Oshokene, who is a former Executive Director, Oil and Gas, and a stalwart of the party in Ward 10, Etsako East Local Government Area of the state, also disclosed that party faithful and loyalists would mobilise to purchase nomination form for the former governor of Edo State to demonstrate their resolve to have him contest the Edo North Senatorial seat. Of recent, there are strong indications that the former President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), is angling to go to the Senate currently occupied by Senator Francis Alimekena who is said to be seeking third term ticket. Eshokene, who made the call in Benin City, said: “Edo State and the senatorial district need a strong representation more than what we are getting now. Edo State has not got the right kind of representation and Edo North has been the worst hit in this. “Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has demonstrated what he can do as a labour leader, as a governor of this state and as national chairman of our party. Our people in Edo North need adequate representation more than we are getting and Comrade Oshiomhole fits the kind of person Edo North needs in the Senate.” He, therefore, appealed to Oshiomhole to listen to the voice of the people in the district and contest the senatorial seat.
