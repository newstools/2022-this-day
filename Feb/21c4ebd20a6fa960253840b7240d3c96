Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Katsina State Chief Judge, Justice Musa Danladi Abubakar, has granted bail to 126 inmates, released one and sentenced three others to community service in the state. The categories of inmates that benefited were the aged, those with serious health challenges as well as those who displayed good character and industry while in custody. Abubakar, in a statement by the Public Relations Officer of the State Command of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Ibrahim Wada, said the decision was to decongest correctional centres across the state. The state chief judge further explained that the prison visit was not meant to usurp the jurisdiction of the courts on cases before them. He noted that cases would be considered on their merit including health grounds, unjustified long detention in prison custody, and want of diligent prosecution, among others. He, however, applauded the hard work and dedication of officers and men of the Nigerian Correctional Service in the state and urged them to sustain the tempo for effective and efficient service delivery. Earlier, the State Controller of Corrections, Muhammad Abdulmumin Haruna, said the decongestion of the custodial facilities would enable the service to perform its statutory duties of reforming, rehabilitating and reintegrating the inmates back to the society as law abiding citizens.
