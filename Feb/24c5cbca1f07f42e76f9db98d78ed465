The recently appointed Executive Chairman of the Edo State Sports Commission, Yussuf Alli, has commended the efforts of Tobi Amusan and Abiola Onakoya to give back their community by developing the youths in Ijebu-land through athletics. Alli urged other privileged athletes with contacts and financial muscle to emulate Amusan and Onakoya and help develop the sport at the grassroots so as to give opportunities to younger ones. The first edition of the Amusan/Onakoya Athletics Meet will hold on Thursday, February 24, 2022, at the Ijebu-Ode International Stadium, Ijebu-Ode. Said Alli in an interactive section with journalists over the weekend. “I am really impressed with the efforts of Amusan and Onakoya, they have not made billions of Naira from athletics and they have shown that you don’t really have to make billions of Naira to give back to your community. They are not only organising a meet for all the secondary schools in Ijebu land, there will also be an open meet where runners from different parts of the country will win prizes, this is really commendable”. Alli appealed to Amusan and Onakoya to take the meet to the next level in the second edition by organising it for all the secondary schools in Ogun State, “They should look for sponsors that will partner them and make it Ogun State Secondary School Athletics Championship. There are lots of talents in Ogun State and all hands must be on the deck to discover and nurture them to become world champion.” Alli also urged other athletes especially those with resources to emulate Amusan and Onakoya, “Nigeria is blessed in athletics like America and the Caribbean Islands, all we need is developmental programmes and athletes who through divine intervention has been able to make it despite all the obstacles on athletes way here should remember the younger ones and assist like Amusan and Onakoya are doing in Ogun State,” he concluded.
