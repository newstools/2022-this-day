On her part, the 3rd accused person, Fatima Jibrin, also pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Relying on Section 36 (6b) of the 1999 Constitution, the lawyer of the accused persons, Mr ML Usman, requested the prosecution to serve him with all facilities in the case within one week to prepare for accelerated hearing. The judge, therefore, granted the application and adjourned to March 2 and 3 for hearing.He, however, ordered that they be remanded in prison custody.

The three suspects were charged with criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, concealing/keeping in confinement a kidnapped person and culpable homicide, contrary to Sections 97, 274, 277 and 221 of the Penal Code.
