Peter Uzoho Renewvia Solar Nigeria Limited, a subsidiary of Renewvia Energy Corporation, has successfully connected about 2,000 new households and over 6,000 residents in five Niger Delta communities to solar hybrid mini-grid power electricity. With the new installations, Renewvia Solar now serves over 10,000 individuals and businesses through thousands of metered connections in eight communities in the Niger Delta, THISDAY learnt. The feat was in advancing the renewable energy company’s mission to improve quality of lives in sub-Saharan Africa through the delivery of clean, reliable and affordable energy to people and communities. The new communities are Balep, Bendeghe-Afi, Ekong Anaku, Opu, and Emeroke, located in Cross River and Akwa Ibom States; Oloibiri and Akipelia in Bayelsa State, and Obokwu Ozuzu in Rivers State. Oloibiri is particularly interesting as it is the location where oil was first discovered in Nigeria, and yet had no reliable and affordable power until Renewvia’s minigrid enabled access to electricity. Commenting on the latest installations, Renewvia’s Chief Executive Officer, Trey Jarrad, said in a statement that the company was constantly driven to improve lives, contribute to building a more sustainable environment and advance social impact opportunities in their places of operation. “Thus, we are deliberate at helping individuals and small businesses thrive and impact their immediate community. We are optimistic that the installed solar hybrid system will continue to positively impact on safety and wellbeing, productivity, gender equality, health and enterprise across these communities. “Our impact extends beyond providing access to cleaner, reliable, and affordable energy, but also in helping Nigeria actualise her global energy transition mandate of cutting carbon emissions towards net-zero by 2060 as declared at the recently concluded Climate Change Conference (COP 26),” Jarrad added.
