Amby Uneze in Owerri The Court of Appeal sitting in Owerri, Imo state capital has reserved ruling on a motion for stay of execution filed by Shell Petroleum Development Company and Shell International Exploration and Product BV over an N800 billion judgment against the company. During the hearing yesterday, counsels to both the appellants and respondents argued on different motions in favour of their case. Counsel to the 1st and 2nd appellants, Sonny Wogu, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), applied for a motion seeking an order for stay of execution of the Federal High Court judgment in appeal number CA/OW/498/20 and appeal number CA/OW/490/20 respectively. On the other hand, counsel to 1st to 88th respondents, Mohammed Ndarant Mohammed SAN, prayed the court to ignore the motion for an order for stay of execution and urged the court to mandate the appellants to deposit the money in an interest account pending the final determination of the appeal. Mohammed also raised fears that the appellants were set to close their office in Nigeria and relocate to another country, which would jeopardize the judgment if nothing was done. After hearing from both parties, the presiding judge, Honourable Justice Rita Pemu, reserved ruling on the motion indefinitely.
