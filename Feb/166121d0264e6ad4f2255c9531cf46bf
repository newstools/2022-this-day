By Vanessa Obioha Today, February 20, 31 students of the Society for the Performing Arts in Nigeria (SPAN) will receive a diploma certificate in their various fields of study at the graduation ceremony at Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. This year, only six singers and 25 dancers met the requirements for accreditation. The occasion will mark the foundation’s first ceremony in three years. It had earlier halted the process partly due to the outbreak of the capricious coronavirus strain, COVID-19. Established in 2005 with a vision to support, empower (through workshops and scholarships), and present the skills, talents, and creativity of the performing artists, the foundation prides itself in producing some of the best talents nationwide. SPAN’s founder, Sarah Boulos, revealed the foundation’s plans to absorb some of its students while others toe the entrepreneurial path. “About 15 of them will be incorporated into the income system of SPAN, and about ten of them are opening their company.” She continued: “Nigerians are creative, and they have a gift. We all have realised now that artists can earn a living without working for a company or being at the bank. You can now become an entrepreneur.” With plans to transcend its current reach underway, SPAN also announced that it will roll out a list of performing arts programs under its Change Factor Season initiative. Harnessing the power of the internet, it will play host to over 6,500 university students in northern Nigeria, where it hopes to nurture creatives using a well-structured curriculum. According to SPAN, it has plans on erecting a performance hub for creatives in the future. So far, the centre has accredited 1,500 students and has trained over 560 teachers.
