HighLife Do not let anyone tell you otherwise: life is delightful with money. This is a fact that some of the wealthiest people in the world have put on display. So, one cannot expect anything less from someone like Nafiu Bala Rabiu. His funds are reportedly closer to being boundless than they are to being measurable. For Nigerians who know Rabiu, it is only normal for the young businessman to live a life of luxury, indulgence, and relaxation. After all, when his mates were still wet behind the ears at 18, Rabiu had already begun preparing a foundation for success by working with some of the most industrious minds to come out of Nigeria. Today, the good-looking Northerner has more going for him than can be seen with even scrying glasses. Rabiu is the MD of Balnara Universal Ltd, a company with long fingers in real estate, rice production and logistics. Unlike his peers, Rabiu runs Balnara with the big picture in mind. Thus, he seems to have a solid grasp of the dynamics of marketing, sales, and continuous business breakthrough, making him an evolving young overlord in Nigeria and beyond. Some people have claimed that if they had as good a start as Rabiu, they would attain the same height as him. But others have countered this logic by asking if these if-it-was-me critics would be able to secure the recognition of indigenous and international organizations for domineering achievements. And this usually ends the arguments. Although Rabiu tries to be lowkey, he seems to attract the clicks of the paparazzi. It probably doesn’t help that he is never caught unfresh while inside a private jet or shopping in well-lit luxury malls. For every ball of sweat is a cup of expensive wine. What a balance! For all the glitz and glamour, perhaps one should modify Tolstoy’s words to fit the situation: wealthy people are all alike, but their impoverished neighbours stare at them all day.
