President of the Nigeria Football Federation and FIFA Council Member, Amaju Pinnick was among eminent members of the global football family who attended the funeral rites of late Mr George Offei Simeon Okraku, father of President of Ghana Football Association, Kurt Edwin Simon Okraku in Accra yesterday morning. Pinnick, who represents the CAF’s Anglophone coalition on the FIFA Council (the highest decision –making organ in world football), flew into Accra on Friday morning for the funeral rites of the 96 –year old Simeon Okraku. Kurt Edwin Simon Okraku, 51, has been Chairman of the Ghana Football Association since October 2019.
“It was important to go to Accra to be with my friend, Simon Okraku as he buried his late father. The death of a parent is always a harrowing experience, no matter how old that parent is. As a FIFA Council Member, it is important to ensure that we have warm relationships among ourselves within and without the Anglophone coalition.”
