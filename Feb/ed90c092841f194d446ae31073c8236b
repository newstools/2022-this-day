Onyebuchi Ezigbo The federal government team and the leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) would hold talks today to iron out their differences. A statement signed by the Deputy Director Press and Public Relations at the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr. Charles Akpan, disclosed that the Minister, Dr. Chris Ngige would be meeting with the Executive of ASUU and relevant government agencies today. Akpan said the meeting with ASUU would take place at the Minister’s Conference room by 1 pm. ASUU had declared a four-week warning strike which commenced on February 14, to express their grievances over non-fulfillment of the agreement with government. ASUU’s demands included federal government’s approval of its University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) payroll software. Other demands included the endorsement of the renegotiated 2009 ASUU-FGN agreement, which it said was concluded in May 2021; release of the reports of visitation panels to federal universities, and distortions in salary payment challenges. ASUU is also demanding funding for the revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, improved funding of state universities and payment of promotion arrears.
