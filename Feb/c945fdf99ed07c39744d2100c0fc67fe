HighLife Very few Nigerians living outside Bayelsa State can claim to understand the doings of Governor Douye Diri. Since coming into power on February 14, 2020, the easygoing governor has proved himself to be as godsent as any other governor in Nigeria might ever hope to be. It is merely two years since he took over from Henry Seriake Dickson but Diri has already attained legendary status in the hearts and minds of Bayelsans. To understand his achievement so far, one must first begin with his verbalised objectives. Diri came out to be governor in the first place to make Bayelsa the glory of all lands, much like the state’s nickname. Despite being notable for his reservation, Diri’s accomplishments have been very loud. Even louder, of course, are the reactions of the Bayelsa people. Whether it is in infrastructural development or social progress, the governor has advanced the state’s level of existence such that it stands on equal footing as regards breadth of development with any other State in Nigeria. On this front, we see his completion of Bayelsa International Airport and the construction and reconstruction of a thousand and one roads in the urban and rural parts of the state. Apart from these, Diri has also proved himself to be a patient and considerate governor. Due to many people criticising him for what they perceived to be aloofness, Diri has been sounded out for his stand on measured advancement. As such, while it originally seemed as if the man was always in his office and doing nothing other than reading newspapers, many foundations were being laid for the state’s march of progress. Time is the revealer of secrets. Now that many of Diri’s promises to the Bayelsan people have been satisfied, many people have nothing but praises for him.
