Society Watch Today, in the nation’s oil and gas industry, Festus Fadeyi’s name evokes a mixture of admiration, envy and respect. He runs Pan Ocean Oil Corporation, a thriving oil exploration and production company in Nigeria incorporated in 1973. Fadeyi is not one of your run-of-the-mill businessmen; he is head and shoulders above several of his competitors in the industry. In fact, you would be doing yourself some good if you consult him for a tutorial before you embark on the business of oil and gas.
When he floated his business, he resolved to pursue his dream on a global stage. Though it looked like an impossible task, he was determined to pursue his ambition of ruling the world with unwavering doggedness.
His company is not only recognised around the world now, but he has the world at his feet. It will not be out of place to say that he has had his own fair share of the bitter-sweet experiences of the typical businessman around the world. Recently, he experienced a low moment in his business. At the time, many naysayers had predicted the collapse of his business empire. But even in the face of it all, the shrewd businessman remained unshaken, believing that he would definitely bounce back. As predicted, the oil mogul cannot be happier now, as he has been cutting deals upon deals, despite the inclement business climate under which many entrepreneurs around the world have operated owing largely to the outbreak of COVID-19 and uncertainty in the oil sector around the world. He has successfully sailed untroubled in the entrepreneurial ocean, navigating numerous business boats with the grace and nous of a veteran captain. But this should not come as a surprise to anyone who has been following his inspiring story with abiding interest.
