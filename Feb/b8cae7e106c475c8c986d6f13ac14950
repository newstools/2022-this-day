Alex Enumah in Abuja Justice Obiorah Egwatu of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court, yesterday ordered the interim forfeiture of 10 properties as well as funds in banks accounts allegedly owned by a former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari. The order, which was sequel to an ex-parte application by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC), is to enable the commission conclude its investigation on the affected assets. The interim order would, however, last for 60 days before which the commission can then apply for final forfeiture. Meanwhile, Justice Egwatu ordered the ICPC to publicise the order for any person or persons with interest in the affected properties to show cause within 14 days why they should not be permanently forfeited to the Federal Government. Some of the properties, according to the ICPC, are in Maryland (USA), Abuja, Kaduna, among others.
