Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has described the passing of the retired Bishop of Lagos West Anglican Diocese, Dr Peter Adebiyi, as a colossal loss.
Bishop Adebiyi, an indigene of Osi Ekiti in Ido Osi Local Government Area of Ekiti State died on Friday. He was aged 79 years. Fayemi, in a condolence message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, said the late Scholar-Priest was an admirable personality, who lived a life of service worthy of emulation. The governor said the late Adebiyi’s life was a testimony of a young church organist whom many people never expected could become a great clergyman; describing him as a humble giant through whom God did many wonders. While noting that Adebiyi was a man of integrity and impeccable character, the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) asserted that the late clergyman jealously guarded that which was entrusted to him by God and the church; leading to the growth of the Anglican Diocese of Lagos West which has no fewer than 270 new churches. Fayemi stated that the late Bishop Adebiyi simultaneously pursued a career in the ministry as well as a parallel career as an academic and taught at Ondo State University (now Ekiti State University) Ado Ekiti between 1983 and 1987 and later lectured at the Lagos State University, Ojoo. “The news of the death of Bishop Peter Adebiyi was shocking and unexpected. He was one of Ekiti’s finest, a worthy Ekiti Ambassador and a man of honour. He was a man of integrity who distinguished himself as a clergyman and an academic. He did not limit himself to the church, he had a second address. “Bishop Adebiyi was an excellent and inspiring Ekiti man who always spoke truth to power. We will sorely miss his wise counsels. May the good Lord grant him eternal rest and give the family the fortitude to bear the loss”, the Governor said.
