Queens Park Rangers have reignited their interest in Tosin Kehinde with a view to signing the former Manchester United winger in the summer transfer window.
It is confirmed that Queens Park Rangers director of football Les Ferdinand was at the King Power Stadium on Thursday, February 17 to run the rule over the Rangers number 10 in the first leg of the Europa Conference League knockout round playoff clash against Leicester City. And the former Nigeria U23 invitee did not do badly despite the huge loss suffered by Randers and the highlight of his performance was providing the assist for the only goal scored by the Superliga side. In the January transfer window, an offer of 1.5 million euros was put forward by FC Copenhagen to sign Kehinde but Randers were not interested in selling the winger at that fee. Meanwhile, the injury suffered by Kehinde in Thursday evening’s Europa Conference League second leg clash at Cepheus Park Randers is not as bad as first feared.
The 23-year-old was stretchered off the pitch in the closing minutes of the game after he was elbowed by Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi.
Kehinde has only a swollen face and has made himself available for selection against FC Nordsjælland on Sunday.
