HighLife One good turn deserves another, so goes the saying. But good people never think about what benefits they might reap in the future. They are only concerned about the affairs of others in the now. From what people are saying, this is what SIFAX Group founder and CEO, Taiwo Afolabi, thinks of General Donaldson Oladipo Diya. And his belief is not unfounded considering that Diya reportedly helped him in the past. It is almost impossible to imagine that Afolabi faced challenges to get to where he is today. Despite that being abnormal in itself, the average person would look at Afolabi’s massive treasure-trove and amazingly expanding list of businesses and assume that the Ijebu man never had to sweat in his entire life. But this is obviously false. There was a time when Afolabi was nothing like he is now, so say insiders. And it was Diya that allegedly got him up and into the path of greatness. For those who know Diya, it is not exactly amazing that he could assist one of the now-wealthiest and most influential businessmen in Nigeria while the latter was still struggling. Diya has been virtually everything from Chief of Defence Staff to de facto Vice President. Diya is a legendary character in the Nigerian Army. His days were the reign (and terror) of the late General Sani Abacha. In fact, so conflicting were their personalities that it is still uttered in hushed tones that Abacha organized the coup against himself which was led by Diya just so that he could do away with Diya. So it is not entirely surprising that this legend would help Afolabi in the latter’s days of struggle. Although some people insist that Diya and Afolabi are just good friends, insiders have stated that the latter has bowed the knee to the former many times, acknowledging their past. In effect, Diya is Afolabi’s benefactor which is why the Marriott Hotel boss loves him. Those who claimed to know insisted they are no longer close again. More on them later.
