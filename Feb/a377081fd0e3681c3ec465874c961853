*94,261 traffickers arrested .Experts attribute spike to quest for illicit wealth
Chinedu Eze Nigeria’s drug trafficking and consumption is spiraling out of control, as it has emerged that the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) seized cannabis and cocaine with a street value of $3.8 billion and $68.17 million respectively in the last 10 years.
The price of cocaine varies depending on numerous factors. The most important factors are location and purity. Cocaine comes from coca leaves. The Coca plant grows in South America, primarily Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.
Due to shipping costs, the farther a buyer is from South America, the more drug traffickers will charge for cocaine. For example, one kilogram of cocaine costs about $1800 in Colombia, up to $34,500 in New York City as much as $45,000 in Anchorage, Alaska.
Conversely, cannabis has a street value of $68.4 per gram in Japan for example, $110.0 per gram in the United Arab Emirates and as much as $22.1 per gram in Singapore. 1000 grams = 1 kilo.

An NDLEA official who spoke to THISDAY said that although the agency is doing a lot to curb drug trafficking, the progressive increase in the volume of drugs and the number of persons arrested seem as if the agency is not doing enough.
“These figures are supposed to be decreasing but indications show that more people get involved in the illegal business. It is a reflection of moral decay in our society. These figures are supposed to be going down but those involved in the illegal business keep on increasing, which means that the drug market is expanding, ”the official volunteered. He attributed the high figures of drug trafficking and illicit drugs to internal decay in NDLEA and said that there is low capacity in terms of personnel adding, “so few people are doing the work more people ought to do.”
The official also said that there is discrimination in the arrest of suspects of drug traffickers because the children of highly placed individuals are let off the hook when they are arrested by the agency. “Truth is that we are weak. The government is weak. They are not funding the agency well and this is tempting because every day the NDLEA officials come across the drug traffickers. It is usually highly tempting when you are offered something because the whole thing is a matter of survival. So the leadership of the agency should find a way to give incentives to the personnel of the agency,” he said. The official also spoke about interference and said that often some drug trafficking suspects are arrested but, “a power from above would order them to the released.”
However, the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of NDLEA, Buba Marwa said recently that the problem of drug trafficking and abuse in Nigeria would soon be under control. “We plan to go to local governments for sensitisation; we are constrained at this moment with the size of our workforce but with the approval of the President, we have recruited more personnel,” he said. He also stated, “We have recruited more personnel to increase our size to enable us go into the local governments so that each local government will eventually have its own special command. We also have special command at the sea ports, international airports and we are in the process of setting up engagement in the railway stations,” he added. SUMMARY OF DRUG SEIZURES AND ARRESTS
