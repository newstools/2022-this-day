Society Watch In 2019, Bayo Adelabu, a former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) top shot had nursed the ambition of becoming the governor of Oyo State. He had been tipped to succeed the late Senator Abiola Ajimobi, who was then the state governor. But it was a most upsetting development when he was defeated at the primaries. Not a few had foreseen the humiliation. Until his fate was determined in the primaries, his fans had egged him on and assured him of victory, believing that he could not be challenged because he is the grandson of the late notable and fearless politician, Chief Adelakun Adelabu, otherwise known as Penkelemesi.
His experience coupled with his huge financial war chest was another major factor that many had thought would work in his favour. In fact, most of his supporters, as well as admirers, believed in him so much that they had begun to address him as “Governor”. But Adelabu, who contested on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was trounced at the polls by Mr. Seyi Makinde of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Without a doubt, it was a terrible blow to his political ambition. But today, he seems to be buoyed by the belief that in life, no dream, no matter how beautiful it may be, comes true by magic. He has, therefore, once again picked up the pieces of his political career and resolved to throw his hat in the ring for the state top job in 2023.
Prior to his appointment as Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), he was an Executive Director/Chief Financial Officer (CFO), First Bank of Nigeria Limited (FBN). He had previously held the positions of General Manager as well as the West African Regional Head of Finance and Strategy (Consumer Banking Business) for Standard Chartered Bank.
He holds a First-Class degree in Accounting from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife and is a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) and a member of the Institute of Directors of Nigeria.
