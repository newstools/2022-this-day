A nursing mother, Mrs Salimot Ajibola, who was abducted by gunmen last Thursday evening at Rounder area of Abeokuta, Ogun State, has been released by his abductors, after collecting N3 million ransoms from her relations. The woman, who was in a car with her husband, her maid and a baby, was reportedly kidnapped by gunmen when they were about driving into their house. It was gathered that the husband became unconscious after the gunmen, hit him on the head during the attack but regained conscious later. A relation of the victims named Aina, said: “Few hours after her abduction, the kidnappers called the family to demand N25 million ransoms for her release. “As negotiations continued, they reduced the ransom to N15 million. The family pleaded and they later settled for N3 million. “The N3 million was taken to a location described by the kidnappers. After they got the money, Salmot was released on Saturday night. “This Ogun State, especially Abeokuta, is becoming something else. I never thought this could happen to someone close to me. It is very sad. The family went through hell to raise the money. The baby was crying for breast. It was just a harrowing experience.” She said that efforts by the police and local vigilantes to rescue the woman failed as they combed the bushes, but to no avail. Contacted, the Ogun State Police Spokesman, Mr. Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident. He, however, said that the police was not aware of any ransom paid to effect the release of the abducted woman. “I am not aware of any ransom paid. But I know she has been released. People will not inform the police when they want to pay money (to the kidnappers). So, we are not aware of any ransom paid,” Oyeyemi said.
