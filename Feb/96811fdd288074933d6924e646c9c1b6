Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City A pressure group, “Push 4 Emefiele 2023 Presidency,” yesterday in Benin City, capital of Edo State, urged the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele to heed the advice of Nigerians and vie for the 2023 presidential election in order to rescue Nigeria from economic woes. The group said that the emergence of the apex bank governor as the president of Nigeria in 2023 would improve the economy of the country among other things. Speaking at a press briefing, the National Coordinator of “Push 4 Emefiele 2023 Presidency,” Mr. Presly Okojie, explained that they are committed to Emefiele’s emergence as president because he has done very well as the governor of CBN for the period he has been in charge. “The man, Godwin Emefiele, was CEO/MD of Zenith Bank until 2014 when former President Goodluck Jonathan appointed him Governor of CBN; and when President Muhammadu Buhari came into power, he reappointed him because of his performance. “Emefiele was the one that introduced the BVN (Banking Verification Number) that has made bank transaction very easy. He also brought Nigeria out of recession twice in five years. Nigeria was having about 3,000 maga watts of electricity, but through his efforts Nigeria has about 5,000 mega Watts today and that is what has brought stability in the power sector. “He anchored the Anchor Borrower Programme, the COVID-19 intervention Programme, the agricultural loans. Our microfinance banks are one of the best today courtesy what Emefiele has done, I believe that if such a man is given the chance, he will make Nigeria an enviable country,” Okojie said. He said that the group would take the campaign to Rivers State then to other south-south states as well as the entire country in the quest to persuade the Delta-born banker to contest the 2023 general election.
