Benjamin Nworie Ebonyi State House of Assembly yesterday elected a new Deputy Speaker, Hon. Kingsley Ikoro, following the alleged resignation of the embattled Deputy Speaker, Hon. Obasi Odefa, as a member of the Assembly. Fifteen out of the 24 members of the Assembly elected the member representing Afikpo North West constituency elected the new Deputy Speaker after Odefa’s seat was declared vacant. The Speaker, Hon. Francis Nwifuru, read the letter of Odefa’s resignation on the floor of the Assembly during plenary. Odefa’s ordeal is not unconnected to his reaffirmation as a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Meanwhile, Odefa said he did not author any letter of resignation as a member of the state House of Assembly and vowed to sue the Speaker for what he described as a forgery. He maintained that he is still the Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, describing his removal as a waste of time and null and void. “You don’t place something on nothing; it does not exist. They lack the powers to purport and forge letters and read on my behalf for my colleagues purportedly written by me. That’s a serious crime if they don’t know. “One thing they don’t know is that no member of the House of Assembly has immunity. In the constitution of this country, only the president, vice president, governor, and deputy governor has immunity. No other person has immunity,” he said.
