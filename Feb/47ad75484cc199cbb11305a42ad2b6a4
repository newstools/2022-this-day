Sifax Group’s N250 million spend on Corporate Social Responsibility in 2021 has further enhanced a history that is constantly growing and evolving, in order to meet the needs of today’s complex business environment, writes Eromosele Abiodun In recent years, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has grown to become an increasingly important metric within the business realm. Sustainability remains a core foundation of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), a central aspect of many CSR policies. Enacting policies that support ESG and CSR may prove to be financially beneficial, as research has found a significant correlation between these policies and higher returns. CSR is not just a business model; it is a practice that ensures businesses practice social responsibility. Businesses that have implemented CSR strategies successfully are those that are conscious of the effects their operations have on society as a whole. The overarching goal of these strategies is to support the wellbeing of society through initiatives that improve areas such as the environment, education, economy, and social issues. The devastating effect of COVID-19 gives CSR even greater prominence as consumers seek to support businesses that align with their morals. Moreover, businesses will look to provide aid in a measurable way, whether it’s providing funds for vaccination drives or purchasing laptops for children who are remote learning. Regardless of the strategies a business chooses to employ, it’s crucial to define and implement these strategies promptly. Meanwhile, research has shown that companies are increasingly ramping up their focus on social responsibility, whether its championing women’s rights, protecting the environment, or attempting to obliterate poverty, on local, national, or global levels. Over the years, some companies in Nigeria has taken the lead in giving back to communities, one of such companies in Sifax Group, a company with a long history of CSR.
