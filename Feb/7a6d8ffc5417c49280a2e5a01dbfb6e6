The 2022 Champions League final will be played in Paris after Russia was stripped of the match following the nation’s invasion of Ukraine. The final of Europe’s most prestigious club competition was due to be played in St Petersburg on 28 May. Following a meeting yesterday, Uefa confirmed the match would not be held at the Gazprom Arena.
Uefa thanked French President Emmanuel Macron for “his personal support and commitment” to have the game moved to France at “a time of unparalleled crisis”. It added: “Together with the French government, Uefa will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.” It is the third year running the venue of the Champions League final has been moved.
In 2020, it was switched from Istanbul to Lisbon because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Turkish city was set to host the game last year instead but it was again moved to Portugal – this time, Porto – because of the pandemic. The decision to strip St Petersburg of the final has been criticised by Russian sporting and political officials. Russian Football Union (RFU) president Alexander Dyukov, who serves on the Uefa executive committee and is the chief executive of Gazprom subsidiary Gazprom Neft, said he “could not support” the move. “We believe the decision was dictated by political reasons. The RFU has always adhered to the principle of “sport is out of politics’,” he said.
