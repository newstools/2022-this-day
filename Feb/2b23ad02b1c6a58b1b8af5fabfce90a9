AFRICA CUP OF NATIONS Hosts Cameroon and record champions Egypt face each other in Yaoundé tonight for a place in the Africa Cup of Nations, Cameroon 2021 final. After the mind game between former Cameroon international and now FECAFOOT President, Samuel Eto’o and Head Coach of the Pharaohs, Carlos Queiroz, 90 minutes will settle their differences on the pitch tonight. Queiroz was angry with Eto’o for describing the game as ‘War’ for the Indomitable Lions. The semi-final match between the two African heavyweights is scheduled to be played at the Stade Omnisport Paul Biya in Yaounde. The Indomitable Lions of Cameroon reached the semi-finals after defeating tournament debutants, The Gambia’s Scopians 2-0 in the quarter-final clash on Saturday. Cameroon are hoping to book their place in the final for the eighth time having participated in the 1984, 1986, 1988, 2000, 2002, 2008, and 2017 finals. Vincent Aboubakar (six goals) and Karl Toko Ekambi (five goals) are the leading goalscorers in this year’s tournament and they could be key to the Indomitable Lions’ win over Egypt. However, Egypt who progressed to the semi-finals after securing a 2-1 win over Morocco in extra-time of their quarter-final encounter which was played on Sunday will also be hoping to reach the final just like they did at the 2017 edition. The Pharaohs are targeting a record-extending 10th appearance in the final having appeared in the 1957, 1959, 1962, 1986, 1998, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2017 finals. Mohamed Salah is in top form at the moment having scored the decisive spot-kick against Ivory Coast in the quarter-finals, before scoring and providing an assist in their win over Morocco. The last meeting between Cameroon and Egypt was on 5 February 2017. Cameroon secured a 2-1 win over Egypt in the 2017 AFCON final which was played at the Stade d’Angondjé in Gabon.
