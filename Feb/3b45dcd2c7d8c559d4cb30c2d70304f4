Sunday Aborisade No fewer than 24 mathematics enthusiasts in primary five, six and junior secondary schools across Nigeria would enjoy full secondary school scholarship education at any of the Nigerian Tulip International Colleges in the country. The Managing Director of NTIC, Fevzullah Bilgin, stated this at the 19th edition of the annual National Mathematics Competition, a yearly event organised in conjunction with the National Mathematics Centre with support from Access Bank Plc. The first round took place last Saturday across the 36 states of Nigeria, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Bilgin explained that the ANMC aimed to give 24 exceptional pupils 100 per cent scholarship which covers their entire secondary school years at any NTIC school branch. He said: “For 19 years, NTIC has been promoting effective teaching and learning of mathematics at the primary levels and developing greater capacity through its annual National Maths Competition. “Over the years, ANMC has only been for Primary 5 and 6 pupils going into JSS1, but this year’s edition is quite exceptional as it comes along with the maiden edition of JSS3 ANMC. “This edition of ANMC has about 15,000 students as participants as we have decided to limit the number of participants due to COVID-19 protocol.” The MD also revealed that “the competition which started in 2003 is now a nationwide prestigious competition responsible for churning out great talents in Mathematics. “NTIC has been sponsoring this competition alone for years and in collaboration with National Mathematical Centre. “After the second round, the top three positions will be awarded a full-tuition scholarship at NTIC plus cash prizes that ranged from N100,000 to N200,000. “The mathematics teachers of such students will also receive cash prizes of up to N100,000. “Their schools will also be rewarded with giant-sized photocopiers to desktop computers, printers, and smart phones.”
