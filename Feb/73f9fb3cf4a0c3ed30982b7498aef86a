Stories by Vanessa Obioha Beloved for her vivacious roles in television series that was punctuated by a magnanimous headgear, Abiola Atanda, popularly known as Madam Kofo, became a household name in the early ‘90s. Although she played the role of a leading lady in the breakout series ‘Second Chance’, her take-home pay was a far cry from the make-believe lifestyle she portrayed. “Those days when we went into theatre in Nigeria, it was the passion that we had for it and not the monetary gains. I didn’t join the theatre for money, I was never even paid.” She made this revelation during the unveiling of the Tube Awards that was held recently.
“I was part of ‘Village Headmaster’, ‘Mirror in the Sun’, and above all, the one that gave me this name – Madam Kofo – today ‘Second Chance’.” “I remember the highest amount of money I was paid. I received N10. And it wasn’t for just an episode. It was for the entire series.” Quirky in more ways than one, the veteran actress who started her professional career in 1967 expressed fulfilment at the growth of the television industry as evidenced in opportunities contemporary thespians are exposed to. A case in point is recognition and support of the upcoming continental award. She stated that the Tube Awards will play a significant role in the advancement of the industry to compete internationally. “The Tube Awards is a welcome idea in terms of all the innovations it brings. The way that we have carried on today is better than what it used to be,” she concluded.
The Tube Awards ceremony is expected to be held this December.
