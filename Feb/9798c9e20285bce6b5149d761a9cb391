HighLife There have been many instances of banking institutions declaring war on the matter of a high-profile customer in Nigeria. But a case like this where Victor Gbolade Osibodu is being chased by Ecobank, a bank that had his wife, Funke Osibodu, as a reigning lord, is quite rare. Which makes for extra intrigue. It seems as if the matter between Osibodu and Ecobank is heating up beyond all expectations. The founder of Vigeo Holdings Limited has already been dragged by his flaps to court. This is the latest development in the matter of Ecobank accusing Osibodu of owing it a debt of approximately N8.7 billion. The backstory can be traced to 2007. Ecobank submitted to the Federal High Court in Lagos that Osibodu had applied for and gotten two loans worth $15 million and $1.75 million in the name of his Vigeo Limited company. He had then gone on to purchase a tugboat, Lady Magret (now Vigeo Olufunke) from a company in Norway. Then Osibodu had yet another opportunity to apply for several loans at once and he did. This time, he got N200 million, N750 million, and N350 million. He was supposed to pay back every year with the interest counting at 16 per cent. But he got the loan even though (according to Ecobank) his personal assets were worth a little over N2 billion. Barely a year later, in June 2008, Osibodu allegedly approached Ecobank again to get another loan worth $2 million. Then in May 2009, he got yet another loan worth $1 million. So in 2016 Ecobank got tired and decided to take action against Osibodu. That is the case that has dragged itself across time to the present day. So Ecobank is fuming at Osibodu not minding that his wife, Olufunke, is forever remembered for being the best CEO the bank ever had. But such is corporate life: you win some, you lose some.
