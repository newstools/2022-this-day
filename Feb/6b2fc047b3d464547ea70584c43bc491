HighLife Whether they be good or bad, all things end. This is not an ode to fate but one of the most reliable facts on the earth. This is something that RevolutionPlus Property Group Executive Director, Tolulope Onalaja, evidently knows. After what can only be described as a hectic number of weeks due to reports of rug pulls and honeypots, the businesswoman is back at her game. And the comeback week just happened to coincide with her birthday. 2021 was a buzz of a year. There were so many frauds and scams in Nigeria and outside that people became extra cautious in their everyday dealings. Thus, when RevolutionPlus Property, a notable real estate establishment took a bit too long to respond to its clients, it became a frenetic online chase. From the reports that came in, RevolutionPlus was supposed to have pulled the rug from under its clients and opted to throw the good reputation it had earned over the years into the bin. People went as far as to drag in the mud the name of every public figure associated with the company, including Nollywood celebrities Toyin Abraham and Odunlade Adekola. Now that Onalaja has made a stirring appearance with her birthday on February 14, 2022, it looks as if the dust has settled. Onalaja is not a big name to outsiders, but this is not the case for the stakeholders and aficionados of the real estate industry. Who does not know the clearest voice in RevolutionPlus, the lady with 18 years of active experience in the industry and enough philanthropic merits to land a global award for the most progressive do-gooders? One can only imagine how relieved Onalaja is at reaching a new age and settling the misunderstandings with RevolutionPlus clients. For her, it is a new year indeed, one that hopefully does not have scheduled dramas waiting to catch us all off guard.
