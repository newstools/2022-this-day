Duro Ikhazuagbe World football governing body, FIFA, has moved the World Cup playoffs between Nigeria and Ghana to new dates for both legs to be played in Cape Coast and Abuja respectively. Ghana’s Black Stars were scheduled to play the Super Eagles of Nigeria in the opening leg on Thursday March 24 in Cape Coast with the return match between both fierce African rivals on March 27 at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja. But yesterday, FIFA through the Confederation of African Football (CAF) informed the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) that the World Cup play-off matches between Nigeria’s Super Eagles and the Black Stars of Ghana will now take place on new dates. It said the opening leg at the Cape Coast Stadium will now take place on Friday, March 25, starting from 7.30pmGhana time, which will be 8.30pmin Nigeria. The crucial return leg fixture in Abuja is to now hold on Tuesday, March29 starting from 6pmNigeria time. Both countries have been calling up players to shore up their respective teams ahead of the playoffs. Apart from the 2006 edition hosted by Germany, Nigeria’s Super Eagles have not missed any edition of the Mundial since USA ‘94 with sacked German Coach, Gernot Rohr, leading the three-time African champions to the last edition in Russia where the team failed to match the usual second round finish. Ghana’s Black Stars were not in Russia and may miss the 2022 edition first time out in the Middle East with Qatar as host in November/December. Both countries gave poor showing at the AFCON hosted by Cameroon last month. Eagles exited in the Round of 16 first time in nearly 40 years while the Black Stars failed to progress from the group stage.
