A chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olumide Aderinokun has described Friday’s court ruling over the leadership of the party in Ogun State as a victory for all. The Ogun Central Senatorial District aspirant called on all aggrieved members of the party to come together and make PDP one in Ogun State. The court, in a judgement passed by Justice J.O Abdulmaliq, upheld Hon. Sikirulai Ogundele as the duly elected chairman of the PDP in the state. “I commend the judiciary for the judgement which signifies the constitution of the party. It is pertinent to note the efforts the party leadership is making for reconciliation in Ogun State,” Chie Aderinokun said. “The judgement is victory for all members and also an extension of olive branch to members who are trying to create factions in the party to come under one umbrella of our chairman, Hon. Sikirulai Ogundele. “Definitely with a united PDP, we will emerge stronger than before and rescue Ogun State and Nigeria in 2023.” A Federal High Court in Abeokuta on Friday, dismissed a suit to uplift Samson Bamgbose’s suspension by the party’s Working Committee in the state.
