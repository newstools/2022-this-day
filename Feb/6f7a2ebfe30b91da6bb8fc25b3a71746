Bayern Munich edged an entertaining game with RB Leipzig to go nine points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. Thomas Muller slotted in a rebound after Peter Gulacsi parried Robert Lewandowski’s shot but Andre Silva poked in an equaliser. Lewandowski scored a powerful header from Kingsley Coman’s cross before Christopher Nkunku’s clever finish for seventh-placed Leipzig. Bayern won it when Serge Gnabry’s shot was deflected in by Josko Gvardiol. It was a 310th career Bundesliga win for Bayern Munich’s Manuel Neuer, equalling the record of fellow goalkeeper Oliver Kahn. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Bayer Leverkusen, who are third, on Sunday.
