According to legislative rules, the lawmakers are expected to sit three times a week, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and the order paper contains daily proceedings of the House.

I’m going to hold whoever is responsible. This house sits at 11, everybody knows that, it’s 11:20, when I came in, nobody was on this floor. None of your deputies were here. Order paper is not ready . What kind of thing is that. What kind of thing is that, we are now forced to adjourn the House. Everybody should see me in my office. House adjourned till Tuesday.” He thereafter called on the Deputy Majority Leader, Hon. Peter Akpatason to move that plenary should be adjourned till Tuesday next week.
