HighLife There is a kind of sparkle that is rarely seen in the women in our history books. It is the sparkle that accompanies a determination to be the best at every endeavour, competing with men and women alike, and bringing home the glory and honour of living through, nay, transcending day-to-day troubles. And that is Shade, the youngest wife of the founder of Eleganza, the Aare of Lagos, Chief Razaq Okoya. Now the face of Eleganza, her shine is laid bare for all to see and admire. Some husbands struggle to let their wives out of the house. They think the world outside is a dangerous place so they keep the women indoors. Chief Okoya is not one of these men. He realised that his Shade is a genius with a high consummate-level grasp of corporate management. So he handed the entire company to her. In her position as Eleganza Group MD/CEO, Shade’s administrative biceps are humongous. So vast and unrestrained is her authority in the company that she is beginning to replace the Aare of Lagos as the face of the company. But this is not without reason. She is just too good at all things executive, which is why there is a multitude of plaques celebrating her meritorious contributions to business management dating back to 2014. Shade does not only have a brain for business. In her 40s, the woman is quite the looker, with a charm and grace that could overturn the sky and get the clouds weeping in shame. It is consequently no surprise that she is immeasurably popular among the ladies of society, equally straddling the position of the wife of a very powerful man and the position of a very powerful woman.
There is no doubt that 2022 is going to be a shakeup of positions in the ranking of corporate women and high-flying MD/CEOs in Nigeria. Shade is very likely to become a household name and a paragon for women everywhere in the country.
