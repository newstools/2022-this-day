By Vanessa Obioha A new management and entertainment company Audience Attention Management is poised to help artists create visions and inspire audiences across the world. Founded by music executive Jonah Chukwu Orji, the new entertainment outfit will provide ample opportunities for collaboration with the film, TV, and fashion sectors. “Audience Attention Management is a place where artists can develop and grow with support from all areas of our business. We are actively expanding and looking for new managers to partner with to expand our roster,” said Orji in a statement. Before launching Audience Attention Management, Orji was Head of Label Operations of DistroPlug, a distribution and label services company based in Accra, Ghana. During his time there, he played a leading role in broadening the Distroplug business by ensuring the company’s independent label partners and artists were provided with the custom services they needed to successfully market, promote and monetise their music. In a similar vein, Audience Attention Management will partner with best-in-class musicians to create their visions and inspire audiences worldwide. While retaining financial backing from investors, the company will offer bespoke representation services to shake up the competitive entertainment-industry representation landscape which transcends beyond music.
