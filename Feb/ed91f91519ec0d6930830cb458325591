Ibrahim Oyewale in Lokoja Kogi State Deputy Governor, Edward Onoja, has admonished youths in the state to always align themselves with those who have productive ideas in order to transform the society for better. Onoja gave this charge while speaking during the inspection of a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Enemona Just Foundation’s project at Inele-Ugoh community in Olamoboro Local Government Area of the state at the weekend. He disclosed that service to humanity is a panacea to societal challenges, commending the Enemona Just Foundation (EJF) for its philanthropic gesture. The deputy governor also commended the leader of the foundation who is in his mid-30s, stressing that he has created a niche for himself by touching lives in many communities in Kogi East, and should be encouraged to do more He lauded the founder of the foundation, Gabriel David, for his philanthropic gesture, which he said has taken many youths off the streets via his employment and empowerment programmes. Onoja commended the founder for prioritising the welfare of widows, orphanage and the people of his community for the move he said attracts God’s blessing here and thereafter. The deputy governor pointed out that apart from touching the physical life of the people of the area, the church building project would take care of the spiritual needs of the people of the community to the goodness of God. Earlier in his remarks, David stated that the gesture was in pursuit of his vision of helping humanity and empowering communities to boost development in order to keep life in rural communities at relative par with those in urban cities. “The foundation was born out of the need to alleviate the hardship faces by the less privileged in term of poverty, poor health, and educational system as well as the increasing economic challenges in the state,” he said.
