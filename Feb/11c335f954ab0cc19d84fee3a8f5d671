Omolabake Fasogbon A Non-Governmental Organisation, Haima Health has sealed a partnership deal with the Lagos State Blood Transfusion Service (LSBTS), to aid seamless delivery of blood to hospitals across Lagos state. This is as the organisation announced the launch of ‘Mobile Project’ which is aimed at addressing logistics challenge that characterised movement of blood for donation centres to hospitals. Speaking at the launch of the project in Gbagada General Hospital, Lagos, recently, Founder of Haima Health, Bukola Bolarinwa stated that the partnership with Lagos was deliberate and strategic to simplify movement of blood across the state. She noted that by such partnership, any hospitals or individuals that reached out to LSBTS for available blood should be rest assured that its logistics personnel are readily on ground to deliver blood to them in their respective location. She said, “Getting blood donors has always come challenging in this clime, so also is transporting the blood to users in their location. “With financial support from Control Risks Group, we are poised to enhance the efficiency of blood delivery using certified cold-chain dispatch bikes for faster delivery of blood to patients across hospitals in Lagos State. These bikes will be stationed at the LSBTS facility in Gbagada, ready to dispatch blood as soon as requests comes in.” Bolarinwa explained that the organisation had been in partnership with LSBTS since 2015, championing a monthly blood drive to improve donor culture among young people. She added that the company decided to expand into logistics chain with the ‘Mobile project’ to be to avert dangers around blood delivery delay. Also present at the launch, Executive Secretary of LSBTS, Dr. Bodunrin Osikomaiya commended the new project and the initiator, more importantly, encouraged healthy people to turn in for blood donation to help save more lives in the state.
