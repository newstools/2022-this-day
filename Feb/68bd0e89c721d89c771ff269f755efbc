Ayodeji Ake The Society of Testing Laboratory Analysts of Nigeria (SoTLAN), has expressed worry over trending adulterated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) issues making waves across Nigeria, saying such products are harmful to human health. Addressing newsmen in Lagos on Tuesday, the President, SoTLAN, Prof. Olugbenga Ogunmoyela, noted that the government need to look into the issue beyond the petroleum industry but also public health, maintaining Nigeria as a society not ready for methanolic PMS products. “SoTLAN, therefore, note with regret , the recent issue of adulterated Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) imported into the country , which has not only been an embarrassment, but has caused severe and unwanted hardship on citizens of the country by way of damage to vehicular engines, fuel scarcity and traffic gridlocks. “It is a known fact that due to the current subsidy regime, NNPC is the sole supplier of all PMS in Nigeria, charged with the purchase, importation, distribution or marketing of petroleum products supplied to some major marketers.” The products delivered were reported to ‘appear hazy and dark and was consequently isolated’ probably following complaints received after having been released.” It is further stated that ‘upon analysis, it was confirmed that the PMS product was contaminated with 20 per cent methanol, which is an illegal substance in Nigeria.” Speaking further, Ogunmoyela, urged the government to take steps to support and empower public analysts and relevant testing laboratories to be able to safeguard the integrity of all materials “SoTLAN wishes to reiterate that we can no longer afford to put the fate of the country in the hands of foreigners. We have scientists and professionals practicing locally of high integrity, who are well respected and recognised all over the world, and we recognise the importance of supporting and investing in the development of our laboratory sector to international standards so that we can look inwards,” he said.
