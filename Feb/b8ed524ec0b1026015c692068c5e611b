The President and Chief Executive Officer of Erisco Foods, Mr. Eric Umeofia, is determined to help Nigeria attain self-sufficiency in food production, writes Nume Ekeghe Local production of basic goods such as rice is one of the hallmark policies of the Muhammadu Buhari administration. And few industrialists epitomise the spirit of local sufficiency better than the Chief Executive Officer of Erisco Foods, Eric Umeofia, an indigenous food product manufacturer incorporated in Nigeria in 2004. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/e4680327-food-production.jpeg?w=696&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> For years, Mr. Umeofia has railed against the unnecessary importation of basic necessities such as tomato paste. But he hasn’t just talked. Since 2009, he has worked to build a local foods company that can match the best in the world producing items such as tomato paste, seasoning cubes, and basmati rice. In 2016, the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, commissioned Erisco’s 450,000 tonnes tomato paste factory in Lagos. At the time, the factory was adjudged to be the biggest of its kind in Africa and the fourth largest in the world. His focus on local production has created thousands of jobs for many Nigerians, helped to conserve scarce foreign exchange resources, and provided higher-quality food products to the local population. He has achieved these feats despite difficult conditions like poor power supply and restrictive government policies, especially in the area of sourcing foreign exchange to purchase heavy machinery. Mr. Umeofia believes that Nigeria can be a manufacturing behemoth if all hands are on deck. “When we started producing tomatoes in can here they said it was not possible, but today we are doing it,” Mr Umeofia said in 2016 during the launch of the tomato factory. “Some people are still deceiving Nigerians that it is still not possible all in a bid to continue importing. “I pray God gives us the power to produce everything about tomatoes here from planting to packing very soon. We are going into tractor projects now as you cannot do agriculture without tractorisation”. Umeofia got his start in business by trading spare parts in Sokoto during the early 1980s. As the business grew, he diversified into safety equipment and fire extinguishers. Frustrated by what he describes as “the lack of standard and foreign influence in our own country” the entrepreneur expanded his business abroad to countries like Angola and UAE. But he wasn’t satisfied with foreign success alone. “After about 10 years we thought of coming back to Nigeria to do something for our country despite our initial frustration,” he said in 2016. “We . . . invested in Erisco Foods Limited to produce tomato paste with the aim of changing the face of the tomato farming system in Nigeria.” However, returning to Nigeria wasn’t a tea party. According to Umeofia, all the banks he approached refused to provide support because of the massive profit they were making from financing tomato imports. He couldn’t understand it. Many Nigerians were unemployed and most people were not interested in investing in a business that would create jobs. “As a matter of fact, backward integration of tomato paste alone can create a minimum of three million jobs, both direct and indirect, in a short period of about 18 months because they require about 15,000 hectares to supply one plant,” Mr Umeofia says. “So, by the time you add up farmers and those who will work in the factories you see that a lot of jobs will be created in Nigeria. But that does not happen today. “We are creating jobs in China while our people are impoverished every year because of the corrupt system, especially from past administration to private sector businesses.” The entrepreneur has acknowledged that attention to local manufacturers has improved under the Muhammadu Buhari administration but he was almost tempted to move his factory from Nigeria to China in late 2016 due to difficulty in sourcing foreign exchange to purchase factory equipment. The issue was resolved and Erisco Foods has continued to thrive locally. Umeofia has strong business interests in states like Sokoto, Kano, and Katsina, where he sources raw tomatoes from. In Jigawa, Erisco has a 460-hectare tomato plantation with more planned in other parts. “If you give me anything to import for N20 billion and make a profit of N18 billion, I will tell you no, let us produce here,” he says. “That is why I am going back to Sokoto . . . to start production of 20-30, 000 tractors per year. The government of Sokoto is willing to assist us and we are also doing tomatoes there.” As the Erisco business continues to flourish, Umeofia hasn’t forgotten to give back by disbursing scholarships, business grants, and even improving public infrastructure – he has built churches and mosques, and roads. In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic tanked the global economy, he launched an N100 million endowment targeted to lift people in his native Amichi community in Nnewi Local Government of Anambra State from poverty. But he is adamant that the greatest corporate social responsibility is running a business that provides employment to thousands and nourishes millions. In a recent interview, the manufacturer noted that agriculture processing isn’t being supported in Nigeria. “I’ve been saying it time and time again. If you don’t support processing and manufacturing in agriculture, all that you do is just a waste of time.” He hasn’t also stopped his criticism of foreign investors who come into Nigeria to benefit from government loans and cart away the proceeds to their home country. He wants more attention to be paid to local manufacturers who take the risk of making things in Nigeria and creating valuable jobs. “Manufacturing is by gift and interest,” he says. “Every genuine manufacturer isn’t fixated on just making money, but we need money to advance our businesses, to extend help to more people.” Mr Umeofia’s long-term ambition is to take Erisco Foods to the stock exchange so that “every Nigerian will benefit from it. “In ten years’ time, our vision is to be in more than one country, to be a Nigerian multinational company,” he says. “We want Nigerians to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner from Erisco”.
