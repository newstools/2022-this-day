He added that: “these equities have been curated with careful thought based on the equities’ proven records of outperforming the market and delivering value to shareholders, regardless of economic conditions over the years.” Some of the equities in the bouquet include shares from, Dangote, MTN Nigeria, AXA Mansard, Fidson Pharmaceuticals, Unilever, Cadbury, UAC Nigeria, R.T.Briscoe, Julius Berger and Sterling Bank. He said, “This is why Sterling Bank has chosen to give something much like true love that grows every day, appreciating in value for the receiver with each passing day. This gift lays a foundation for a life of value; by starting the young customer on a path for continuous earnings tomorrow and beyond with an investment in today’s best stock options. “The first 50,000 youths to open the new accounts and complete the application process by having their BVNs validated will receive the equities within 48 hours after their BVNs have been validated and will be free to transact in the equities once their portfolios are set up. Like most opportunities that come knocking, some will embrace it and commence a lifetime of saving and investing, ultimately leading to their financial freedoms and goals while others will squander the gift.” Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of I-Invest, a leading tech-based investment firm and creators of Nigeria’s first treasury bills investment mobile app, Mr. Seye Olusoga, commented that the selected companies have a combined valuation of over eight trillion Naira on the NGX as of 11 February 2022, with recipients of these special gifts given the opportunity to create a better future by making the right choices today.
