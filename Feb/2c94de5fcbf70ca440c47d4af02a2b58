Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano Kano State Director for Public Prosecution, Barrister Aisha Mahmoud, yesterday, informed the Magistrate Court trying three suspects in connection with the murder of a five-year-old, Hanifa Abubakar, that it would terminate the trial following the successful filing of a fresh case before a Kano High Court. Mahmoud, who also doubled as the prosecution counsel, told the Magistrate that, “We filed the charges, because the offence alleged to have been committed by the defendants is not triable by this court.” She further explained that already, “The Kano Chief Judge, has directed the case to High Court Number 5. We apply for another date to terminate the First Information Report (FIR) before this court.” Following this, the Chief Magistrate adjourned sitting to February 9, 2022, in a criminal trial against Abdulmalik Tanko and his two other accomplices over the alleged murder of the five-year-old. The Chief Magistrate, Muhammad Jibril, subsequently ordered the remand of the defendants in a correctional centre. Tanko alongside Hashimu Isyaku, 37 and Fatima Musa, 26, have been docked on a four-count charge of culpable homicide, conspiracy, kidnapping and concealing/keeping in confinement a kidnapped person.
