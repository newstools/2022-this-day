On the heels of growing operating expenses and net exchange difference, Caverton Offshore Support Group Plc recorded one of the worst result and accounts in its full year ended December 31, 2021. Though the support and logistics company listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) recorded increase in revenue, several mitigating factors such foreign exchange loss due to local currency devaluation by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and cost of operating its 27 aircraft play a critical role in the company’s worst performance in over 10 years. Caverton reported a loss of N5.9billion in 2021 unaudited result and accounts for period ended December 31, 2021 from N1.26billion profit before tax reported in prior year result and accounts.
This simply means that the management of Caverton might not be paying shareholders dividend for the first time in four years. The management had recommended payment of dividend of 10 kobo per share in respect of the year ended 31 December 2020 (2019: 20 kobo per share). Between 2018 and 2017, it proposed a dividend of N0.25 and N0.15 kobo, respectively. Apparently, the decline in global oil prices led to lesser contracts for Caverton, as most of its clients struggled to survive the economic hardship necessitated by COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2021. It reflected in the company’s H1 unaudited results as the management battled to manage its operating expenses amid minimal growth in revenue. The company in H1 2021 reported N18.07billion revenue, 12.4per cent increase from N16.08billion reported in H1 2020, while operating expenses grew significantly by 12 per cent to N11.7billion in H1 2021 from N10.5billion reported in H1 2020. Reduction in finance cost impacted positively on Profit before tax in H1 2021, gaining about four per cent to N924.5million in H1 2021 from N889.14million in H1 2020. However, in the nine months of 2021, the support and logistics company was able to enhance revenue amid the relaxation of travel restrictions occasioned by the pandemic and increased economic activities that drove recovery in the aviation sector. Operating Expenses
But, operating expenses, among other financial parameters continued to amount to put the company’s profit at risk. Revenue reported in nine months ended September 2021 stood at N27.08billion, an increase of 15 per cent to N23.63billion reported in nine months of 2020, while operating expenses grew by 16.3 per cent to N18.27billion in nine months of 2021 from N15.7billion in nine months of 2020.
Net finance charges thus gained 23 per cent to N3.3billio in nine months of 2021 from N2.67billion in nine months of 2020. The growth in operating expenses and finance charges dragged Caverton’s profit before tax downward to N1.2billion in nine months of 2021, a decline of 27.4 per cent from N1.54billion reported in nine months of 2020. Meanwhile, the company’s in the last quarter (Q4) of 2021 performance failed to reflect steady increase in global oil price as revenue dropped by nearly seven per cent to N7.98billion from N8.55billion reported in Q4 2020.
Amounting operating expenses in Q4 2021 grew by 221 per cent to N9.25billion from N2.88billion reported in Q4 2020. Caverton’s whose business model is such that its logistics services are mostly needed by local and international oil and gas companies in Nigeria when its customers in the oil & gas sectors are making money. What this means, therefore, is that as global demand for crude oil rises, Caverton had struggle to compete in the support logistics services for local and international oil & gas companies operating in the country. Currently, Caverton contends with Bristow Helicopters and OAS Helicopters for market share. These two companies are understandably making their own expansion moves with hopes of taking more advantage of the market. More so, Caverton must also ensure to reduce its liabilities and operational costs down. Expenses Outshines Revenue

The Chief Executive Officer, Caverton, Mr. Bode Makanjuola in a statement said the loss was caused by the significant reduction in revenue due to several mitigating factors because of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in drop in oil production and net foreign exchange loss due to Naira devaluation against the dollar. “As a result of this our direct costs increased significantly in 2021,” he said.
He explained further that, “notwithstanding the loss reported in 2021, Caverton has robust reserves to accommodate this loss and a bulk of the reported loss is a one-time charge on our accounts which arose from high start-up costs of our most recent helicopter contract with Chevron. “To further boost revenues, the Group has been exploring further opportunities within and outside the oil and gas sector. In addition to growing our market share in the oil and gas logistics sector, our primary focus for the year will be on third party training and maintenance. “Our Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility and our Caverton Aviation Training Centre (CATC), both in Lagos, officially commenced business operation in the 2nd half of 2021. Prospects for training and maintenance is extremely positive as we are in advanced contract negotiations with a number of government and private institutions across Sub-Saharan Africa.” “CATC full flight simulator gained full certification by EASA, (European Union Aviation Safety Agency), in October 2021. The EASA’s mission is to promote the highest common standards of safety and environmental protection in civil aviation. “The Agency develops common safety and environmental rules at the European level. With global certification by an internationally recognized body CATC is now suitably qualified to undertake simulator training on the AW139 helicopter for Pilots from Nigeria and any part of the world and we expect this to not only boost the Group’s revenue in the coming year, but also reduce capital flight from Nigeria.”
