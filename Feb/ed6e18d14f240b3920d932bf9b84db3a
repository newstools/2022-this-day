Abubakar expressed concern about the security situation in the country when he spoke at the Federal University of Technology Minna Niger state where he and the President of the African Development Bank ADB Dr Akinwunmi Adeshina and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Malam Mele Kyari were conferred with honorary doctorate degrees as part of activities marking the 38th founders’ day and 30th convocation of the university. “We are facing a very hard time in this country. We are fighting a war without any morality, without any force. Let us all join hands with security agencies by providing useful information on how to secure the territorial integrity of this nation,” Abubakar said. He also encouraged the citizens to monitor their immediate environments for aliens with evil intents saying: “As we move towards 2023, I appeal to politicians across all three tiers of government to desist from using our children, our grandchildren and our youths as tools for self-destruction”. Abubakar also told politicians to avoid acts capable of building undue tension and destroying the country and her citizenry in the march towards 2023 general elections. Abubakar advised politicians seeking election into political offices at all levels to, “adhere strictly to the rules of the game,” adding that they should refrain from the deployment of youths who are the future leaders to serve as their political thugs,” which he said would amount to destroying the future leaders of the country. The former Head of State charged the youths not to, “accept the offer by personal gain seeking politicians to engage in self-destruction,” but seek for better opportunities which can be provided if they worked towards choosing or voting for leaders who would work for the collective interest of all Nigerians not minding their religious, tribal or political inclinations.
