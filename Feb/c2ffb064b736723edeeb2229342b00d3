Sunday Ehigiator MusicEco, a music app, aimed at bridging the promotional gaps between artistes and Nigeria radio stations, has been launched in Nigeria. In a statement jointly signed by the co-developers, Kayode Yahaya, Seyi Odumosu and Sunday Falae, they explained that the App would easily facilitate a union between artists who wishes to promote their songs on radio anywhere in Nigeria, without the aid of promoters, and the radio stations they wished to be featured. According to the statement, “MusicEco was developed to solve a problem that artistes are facing, which is how musicians get their music to radio. When artistes, artistes’ managers and record labels attempt to promote their music on radio they reach out to promoters to do this, but most of the time these opportunistic promoters take advantage of them and they never get value or representation for this service. “The platform bridges the gap between signed and independent artistes by giving them tools that drive their music to larger audiences fast. It can really be the difference between an actually talented artiste and artistes who just throw money around. Independent musicians can focus on their music while having the autonomy and control of how they get their music to radio. It’s as simple as signing in on your phone or device and uploading your music.” On how to subscribe the App, they noted that signing up on the platform was free, but a realistic fee of N26, 000 is charged to distribute artistes’ music to radio. They added: “Throughout 2022, we are introducing so much more opportunities that go beyond just serving as a medium to radio. Artistes who use the platform get on our specially curated playlists are guaranteed to get their streams up. They can find opportunities like performance gigs, interviews, record deals, and so much more. The Idea is to create a working community that can nurture, represent and discover artists.”
