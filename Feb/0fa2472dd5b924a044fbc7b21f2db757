Juliet Akoje in Abuja The House of Representatives has urged the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to erect signage and directional road signs across the country. This resolution followed the adoption of a motion on the need to make ‘Provision for Adequate Signage and Directional Road Signs on all roads in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja’, which was moved by Hon. Kolawole Taiwo Musibau at the plenary yesterday. Musibau, while presenting the motion, noted that signage and directional signs promote orderliness and make the society more efficient, as it makes locating places and navigation of facilities convenient and easy for users. He said most civilized cities across the world have adequate signage and directional road signs for usage by both inhabitants and visitors. He added that there are inadequate signage and directional road signs on some major roads in the FCT, and some of the existing ones are either worn out or poorly fixed, making it difficult for people to navigate within the city. According to him, “The impression of the international community about the FCT when locating places of interest and business is difficult. “Many accidents have occurred as a result of motorists not being able to concentrate on driving as they encounter difficulty in navigating using the available road signs. “Easy access to correct locations and addresses can be very difficult in cases of emergency.” The House, however, mandated its Committee on Federal Capital Territory to ensure implementation.
