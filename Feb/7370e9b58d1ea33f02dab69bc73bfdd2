Vanessa Obioha Popular indigenous radio station Wazobia FM recently announced plans to celebrate the resilience of Lagosians through its grassroots initiative tagged ‘Wazobia Suya’. This, it said, is to strengthen the spirit of communal relationship across the grassroots population of Lagos while also creating a platform for them to air their opinions on issues that deal with the country’s overall socio-economic development. Deploying the popular barbecue meat, the station seeks to entertain people with ‘suya’ at diverse entertainment spots across Lagos while they engage in discussions around national issues alongside the presenters of the ‘Evening Oyoyo Show’ Expensive and Solid AC. “Wazobia Suya” is an initiative that seeks to provide an entertaining platform aimed at fostering social inclusion among the grassroots population of the country, particularly in Lagos,” said the General Manager of Corporate Communication for Wazobia FM, Femi Obong-Daniels. “We, as a brand, understand the essence of creating an enabling environment aimed at promoting social inclusion across the grassroots population of Lagos in entertaining ways. This is because we recognize that the grassroots play a critical stakeholder in the socio-economic and political development of the State, including the nation at large. It is on this backdrop that we flagged off the ‘Wazobia Suya’ in order to foster the spirit of communalism while we appreciate the support they have displayed towards the brand over the years.” Listeners are to tune in daily to find out when the station would visit their locality.
