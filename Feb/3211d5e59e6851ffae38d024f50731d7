This was done recently at the just concluded 10th year anniversary of the foundation, which held in Ibadan, Oyo state, Nigeria. Honourable Akin Alabi, a member of the House of Representatives representing Egbeda/ Ona Ara Federal Constituency in Oyo State, is also a philanthropist who established the Akin Alabi Foundation in 2011, a non- governmental organisation (NGO) that is aimed at touching lives as well as alleviating Nigerians out of poverty. As part of the celebration, he gathered both the young and old and had a prayer session where he was full of thanksgiving on how far the foundation had come. Speaking on the sidelines of the event , the lawmaker said he was grateful to God for the consistency to be able to hold this annual event for the past decade, adding that he’s looking forward to doing more. He said : “ We empowered 112 women with cash gifts as part of our 250 million empowerment program that has been going on for two years. ” I also hosted hundred youths and gave them a mini seminar where I taught them business and marketing. I also gave them free copies of my best selling books, Small Business Big Money and how to sell to Nigerians.” Akin Alabi’s foundation has successfully implemented projects like building and donating classrooms to primary schools, sinking of boreholes where there is scarcity of water and empowerment of widows. So far, over a thousand and half people have benefited from the initiative in a decade.
