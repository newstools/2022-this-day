Two students of D.S. Adegbenro ICT Polytechnic, Itori in Ogun State, were in the early hours of yesterday allegedly kidnapped by suspected unmen, who reportedly stormed one of the private hostels of the school. The gunmen, according to a source, attacked the hostel in Afowowa area of the town in Ewekoro Local Government Area of the state at about 1 a.m. The criminals were said to have operated for almost four hours unhindered. The source said: “They made away with laptops and other belongings of our colleagues. We called the police but there was no response. Later, the police said their vehicle was not in good condition.” Angered by the incident, the students yesterday morning blocked the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway. The students said they were angry because the police allegedly refused to respond to distress calls, saying the attack lasted for almost four hours unimpeded. According to one of the protesting students, “When they finally arrived on the hostel, they urged the students to lie down. One of the students was shot in the leg and others were badly injured. That is why we took to the street to protest.” The action of the students caused heavy traffic on the expressway as many commuters were stranded on the road for several hours. It was gathered that some police vans were stoned at the beginning of the protest. When contacted, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, said he was aware of the protest. However, Oyeyemi said he had not been fully briefed on the cause of the demonstration.
