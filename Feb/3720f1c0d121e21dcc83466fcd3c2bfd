Gwamna, who is nursing governorship ambition in the oncoming 2023 general elections, tendered his resignation letter to the Jekadafari Ward Chairman of APC on Tuesday. Gwamna explained in the resignation letter that he made the decision after wide consultation with his family, political associates and supporters.
