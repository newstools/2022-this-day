Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Katsina State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has stated that Shehu Audu still remained its chairmanship candidate for Daura Local Government ahead of the April 11 council election in the state despite allegations against him. The APC Chairman, Muhammad Sani Ali, who disclosed this to journalists in Katsina, said the ruling party had no plan to replace Audu with any APC chieftain in the area for the council poll. THISDAY had reported that Audu had been arrested and detained by officials of the State’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for allegedly obtaining money from some youths in the local government under false pretence. But Ali, during the media chat, explained that Audu was still the party’s chairmanship candidate for Daura despite the allegations leveled against him until proven otherwise by court. He said: “APC primary elections were held for both councillorship and chairmanship in Daura Local Government Area, and Shehu Audu won as chairmanship candidate. How can we then change or impose another candidate? “That rumour is not true. We have forwarded his name to the Katsina State Independent Electoral Commission as our chairmanship candidate for the April 11 local government election”. He, however, said: “I know there are some aggrieved persons who wrote a petition to the security agencies against him and he was arrested, the party did not lodge any complaint against him to the security agents. “The eight aggrieved persons didn’t bring any complaint to the party during the primary election, but they later did so and I forwarded it to the party’s Appeal Committee to treat. As far as we are concerned, the party is going to be free and fair to everyone”.
