FRANCE’S LIGUE 1 Super Eagles star, Moses Simon, was in action for 90 minutes last night as Nantes inflicted the second French Ligue 1 defeat on Paris St-Germain this season. Nantes profited from a superb opening 45 minutes to upset the leaders 3-1. Mauricio Pochettino’s side – unbeaten in Ligue 1 since October – fell behind to a smart Randal Kolo Muani finish. Nantes keeper Alban Lafont was inspired all night and made key saves before Quentin Merlin fired in a superb second and Ludovic Blas slammed in a penalty. Neymar struck just after half-time but had a tame penalty saved on the hour. Brazilian Neymar’s woeful effort was weak and summed up a testing night for PSG, who were rocked by Nantes’ adventurous first-half approach. Much credit must go to keeper Lafont, who denied Lionel Messi at 1-0, Kylian Mbappe at 2-0 and then stood tall to save and hold another Neymar effort when the frontman had an age to size up a chance before the interval. That miss from Neymar was further punished when Georginio Wijnaldum handled in the area in stoppage time, allowing Blas to open up a three-goal lead at the break. Messi – making an 800th club appearance of his career – fed Neymar in the build-up to PSG’s goal two minutes after the interval – and it looked like they would build momentum when Dennis Appiah brought down Mbappe in the box.
