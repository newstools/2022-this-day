Laleye Dipo in Minna A major administrative reshuffle was carried out by the Niger State Governor, Mr. Abubakar Sani Bello sending fears into political appointees of an imminent cabinet shakeup. In the administrative reshuffle, which has already taken effect not less than 13 Permanent Secretaries were moved to different ministries. The reshuffle was contained in a circular signed by the State Head of the Civil Service, Ms. Salamatu T. Abubakar, in a letter with reference number HoS/NS/044/T dated 1st February 2022 and addressed to all those concerned, including the Clerk of the House of Assembly and the Secretary to the State Government. The circular directed all those redeployed to resume at their new duty posts latest the 8th of this month adding that the ” handing and taking over notes” should be sent to the office of the Head of Service immediately. “I write to convey the approval of Mr. Governor on the posting of the attached list of permanent secretaries. The officers are expected to report on or before Tuesday, February 8, 2022, and you will kindly avail this office with handing/taking over notes” the posting letters read in part. The sudden administrative reshuffle announced by the government has again aroused fears that a cabinet reshuffle may be in the offing. It was gathered that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello had been toying with the plan to change members of his cabinet but at the last minute always put it off. According to a commissioner, the governor at one of the last executive council meeting late last year directed the commissioners to go and hand over their office to the permanent secretaries in their ministries only to change his mind a few hours later. The Chief Pressure Secretary to the Governor, Mary Noel Berje, could not be reached for her comment.
