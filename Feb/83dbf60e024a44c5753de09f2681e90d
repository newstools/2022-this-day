Innocent Megbolu Nigeria’s leading healthy food chain, So Fresh, has helped 1,700 Nigerians commit to a healthy start in an initiative tagged the ‘Eat Clean Challenge’. The two weeks challenge had participants provided with a detailed Healthy Meal Plan and Eating Guidelines, community support and coaching sessions. They were also treated to daily health information tips and nutritional guidelines to propel and help them start off the year with a healthy lifestyle. Brand Communication Manager, Modupe Aremo, said So Fresh remains committed to inspiring a healthier nation by changing the mindset of Nigerians about healthy living, creating easy access and convenience around accessing healthy food. “We would achieve this by increasing our outlets and bringing fresh, safe, and healthy meals closer to the people, with 15 So Fresh stores already in both Lagos and Abuja, our goal is to expand to 25 stores in five states by the end of this year,” she added. A healthy and productive nation, Amero noted, starts with healthy people and So Fresh is committed to being the driver for helping Nigerians lead that lifestyle. She further hinted that the importance of making healthier food choices daily has even become apparent over the last two years as the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic. For So Fresh, however, adopting healthier habits such as maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and following a clean, healthy diet is associated with a strong immune system and prevention of non-communicable disease. According to the World Health Organisation, regularly following these healthier habits contributes to 80 per cent reduction in the risk of developing the most common and deadly lifestyle diseases. And So Fresh, Nigeria’s number one premium healthy food chain for a wide range of fresh, delicious, nutrient-rich and healthy meals, is bent on revamping unhealthy lifestyles.
