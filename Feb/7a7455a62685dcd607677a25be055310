After a complaint on the lack of power supply in Aso B Community, Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State and the request for electricity bill by AEDC despite unavailability of power, the officials of the company visited some houses in the area a day after a publication, and assured the people of getting power the next day. Because of that promise perhaps, there was low current of power from 11am to 11:39am the next day. Thereafter, the power was taken and later restored for one hour same day. That became the fulfillment of the promise made to the people! As I write there is no power supply in Aso B Community and the so called AEDC still asks people to pay. What AEDC is doing is not right. I have followed with keen interest the privatisation of PHCN and I have not seen where AEDC is allowed to collect money from people even when there is no supply of power. We cannot continue to allow AEDC shortchange us. We must put a stop to this systematic robbery. Awunah Pius Terwase, Mpape, Abuja
