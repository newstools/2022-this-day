Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo The Olowu of Kuta, Oba Adekunle Makama, Tegbosun III, has raised the alarm on the alleged infiltration of non-state actors stockpiling arms and ammunition at the behest of some politicians in Osun State. In a statement personally signed by him, the Olowu at the weekend in Osogbo, the state capital, said he’s disturbed by the activities of criminals who have infiltrated the state in order to perpetrate violence. The monarch maintained that despite his security consciousness, some criminals have infiltrated the state with arms and ammunition to foment trouble. According to him, “The member representing Ayedire federal constituency in the House of Representatives and party executives in the local government area were having a sensitisation programme when some hoodlums wielding dangerous weapons started shooting sporadically at the defenseless people without any provocation.” The Oluwo admonished politicians and their supporters to eschew violence, adding that it’s an ill wind that blows no one any good.
He, therefore, called on law enforcement agencies in the state to double their effort and ensure that there’s no breakdown of law and order as the state election draws nearer. The traditional ruler, however, urged well-meaning citizens of the state to join in the crusade so that those bent on perpetrated violence would be fished out and made to face the full wrath of the law.
