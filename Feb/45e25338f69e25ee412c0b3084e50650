Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that affects both men and women. Trichomonas Vaginalis is a protozoan parasite that causes this condition. This infection is not spread through casual contact, so you cannot get it from sharing food or drinks, kissing, hugging, holding hands, coughing, sneezing or sitting on toilet seats. It is easily disseminated during sex since it is carried in sexual fluids such as the pre-cum and vaginal fluid. About 70% of affected people do not have symptoms when infected and so spreading this disease is very easy. When symptoms occur, they typically begin between 5 to 28 days after exposure, and about 20% of people get infected again within three months of treatments. Trichomoniasis produces a foul-smelling vaginal discharge, itching in the genital area, and painful urination in women. Trichomoniasis is a treatable disease. Although symptoms of the disease may vary, so most people cannot tell if they are infected. Trichomoniasis can be spread through:
• Vaginal, oral, or anal sex: It can be spread even if there are no symptoms. This means you can get trichomoniasis from someone who has no signs or symptoms.
• Genital touching: A man does not need to ejaculate (cum) for trichomoniasis to spread. It can also be passed between women who have sex with women. RISK FACTORS
Risk factors include having:
• Multiple sexual partners
• A history of other sexually transmitted infections
• A previous episode of trichomoniasis
• Sex without a condom SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF TRICHOMONIASIS
Many people with trichomoniasis may not have any symptoms, but they can still spread the infection to others, so using condoms and having safer sex is the best way to prevent trichomoniasis, even if you and your partner seem totally healthy. It is common for the symptoms to come and go, but that does not mean the infection went away.
Most infected women and men with trichomoniasis have no symptoms. If they do get symptoms, they might appear 5 to 28 days after exposure. Symptoms may include the following:
• Genital redness, swelling, burning and itching.
• Blood in your vaginal discharge.
• Thin or frothy discharge with an unusual foul odor that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish.
• Pain or discomfort during sex.
• Lower abdominal pain (this is rare).
• Irritation inside the penis.
• Burning with urination or after ejaculation.
• Discharge from the penis.
• The urge to pee more than usual. COMPLICATIONS OF TRICHOMONIASIS
If Trichomoniasis is left untreated, it may lead to damage throughout the body. It may also increase the risk of HIV infection and can cause problems during pregnancy. Treatment can help prevent future damage but cannot repair or reverse damage that have already occurred.
Pregnant women who have trichomoniasis may:
• Have higher risk of a premature birth (babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy).
• This infection may cause a woman to deliver a low birth weight which may raise the risk of health and developmental problems at birth and later in life.
• Transmit the infection to the baby as he or she passes through the birth canal.
• Having trichomoniasis increases the risk of transmission and infection of Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS.
• This infection is also known to be a cause of cervical cancer and may be associated with co infection with high risk strains of Human papillomavirus (HPV).
• This infection in males causes asymptomatic urethritis and prostatitis which leads to chronic inflammation and hence, prostate cancer. EFFECT OF TRICHOMONIASIS ON FERTILITY
Trichomonas vaginalis is a common parasite of the male genital tract. In men, this has been associated with urethritis (swelling of the tube that connects to the urinary bladder for the removal of urine), prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland), epididymitis (inflammation of the tube that connects the testicle to the vas-deferens), and inflammation is associated with oxidative stress which is known to impair sperm function. The proteinases released by this trichomonas vaginalis can also inhibit sperm motility. In the male reproductive tract, this microorganism is found in the urethra and the sub-preputial sac, and the infection can cause lesions in the penis. It may also lead to deficit of sperm cell quality and function due to physical damage. In women, trichomoniasis has been related to infertility due to pelvic inflammatory disease that compromises tubal patency. In female, this microorganism is found in the vagina, urethra, and para-urethral glands. In women, trichomoniasis vaginalis has been linked to vaginosis(a condition results from an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina), vaginitis (infection or inflammation of the vagina or vulva), endometritis (endometritis is an inflammation of the inner lining of the uterus or endometrium), Adnexitis (adnexitis is an inflammatory diseases that is generally affecting the fallopian tubes and ovaries) and can trigger inflammatory responses in the mucosal genital tract, increasing the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease………………………………..……………………TO BE CONTINUED
