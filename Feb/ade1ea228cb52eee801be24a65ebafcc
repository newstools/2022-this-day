David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Anambra State Police Command has confirmed the discovery of the bodies of two students of Nnamdi Azikiwe University in a room last Sunday night. The students, a male and female, were discovered in their room after their neighbours perceived an offensive stench coming out from the room, however, when the door was forced open, their bodies were discovered. In a statement issued by the state Police Command’s spokesperson, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, the command said a comprehensive investigation into the incident had been ordered, but also stated that preliminary investigation pointed to carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of the fume emitted by power generating set in the room. Ikenga in the statement said: “The Commissioner of Police, Echeng Echeng, today February 21, 2022, wishes to enlighten the public, especially Ndi Anambra, on the dangers of carbon monoxide. “It’s a dangerous substance that is very toxic to the health. This substance, when inhaled, can cause serious damage to the body and can lead to death. The substances are mostly emanated from generators, water heaters, coal burning appliances or any gasoline powered engine.” He said the CP gave the warning on the discovery of two lifeless bodies in an apartment in Awka, and that he has ordered a comprehensive investigation into the discovery of two lifeless bodies in a room at a student lodge. He added: “Preliminary investigation reveals that fume from the generator was strongly perceived from the room when the door was forcefully opened by police officers who responded to the distress call. Meanwhile the recovered bodies were deposited in the morgue, and no mark of violence was found on them. “However, the command urges the public, most especially generator users, to keep them away at safe distance from the window or any place the fumes can penetrate into the house, to avoid such poisonous fumes like carbon monoxide causing harm to one’s health.”
