Mary Nnah The Lions Club International, District 404B2, Lagos Mainland Legacy Lions Club has reached out to over 500 internal displaced persons at IDP camp Oko-Oba, with food and other palliative measures to cushion the present economic hardship during a one-day programme tag “Feeding the Hungry”. The President of the club, Lion Rukky Origho-Nwoye, while appealing to Nigerians to cultivate the habit of providing succour to the downtrodden, urged Nigerians to see charity as a way of life. “The nation is faced with the issue of finance, probably because of the prevailing economic challenges but we should try to remember them and show a little kindness. “Most of our revenue comes from membership. So, we do this with the resources available, we need others to support the vision, they need more than food, children’s education fees, clothing, medical care, and other things to make life bearable a bit for them. “I encourage kindhearted Nigerians to join us to expand our area of coverage and expand our service or even, on their own, give helping hand to these persons – they are vulnerable. It is a call to service to all Nigerians, regardless of whether they are Lions or not,” she added. The President disclosed further that the project was in line with Lions Club International 5 Global Causes, adding that the project is aimed at actualising her promise at the commencement of the Lion year last July and during her installation as President of Lagos Mainland Legacy Lions Club. “I promised to reach out to vulnerable of underprivileged to feed the hungry and increased their living conditions. Today that dream is being actualised”, she added. She expressed profound gratitude to God and members of the club have committed all their resources to ensure that the event was a huge success.
