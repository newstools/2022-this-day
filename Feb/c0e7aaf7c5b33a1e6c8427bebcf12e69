In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited predicted that the stock market is to mellow as corporates that opted for 60-days filing option may release their audited full year 2021 results in the next two weeks; hence, we feel the new week will largely be quiet. Cordros Capital stated that “This week, we expect investors to take advantage of the moderation in the share prices to make a re-entry in dividend-paying stocks ahead of subsequent 2021 full year earnings releases. However, we believe investors will remain reluctant to leave gains in the market. “As such, we expect intermittent profit-taking to continue due to uncertainties about the direction of yields in the fixed income (FI) market. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.”
