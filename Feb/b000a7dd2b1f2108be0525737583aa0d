Ugo Aliogo The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, FITC, the innovation-led and technology-driven knowledge institution, Chizor Malize, has said the advent of digital financial services has created faster, more efficient, and typically cheaper banking solution compared to traditional financial services. Malize stated this recently in Kigali, Rwanda, when FITC hosted its flagship risk-based supervision (RBS) for Fintech programme to enhance stability and stimulate growth in the financial sector, as part of efforts to continuously equip the financial services and other sectors with the invaluable knowledge needed to navigate complex and dynamic regulatory supervision practices in the fintech space. “Technology continues to change the face of the financial services industry. The advent of digital financial services has created faster, more efficient, and typically cheaper banking solution compared to traditional financial services. Many Fintechs have experienced a surge in demand as the customer banking habits changed in the COVID-19 era. Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, it was clear that FinTech would play a pivotal role in financial services going forward. COVID-19 has undoubtedly accelerated that process,” Malize stated. According to her, RBS for Fintech is the leading approach to regulatory supervision of Fintech’s globally, disclosing that to ensure safety, soundness, and financial stability within this evolving industry in the financial services sector, central banks in Africa need to build strong regulatory framework for supervising Fintech development within the African financial system. “We currently have about 576 Fintech companies, enablers, funding partners, as well as numerous key stakeholders such as banks, telcos, and even governments. Many of our local start-ups have gone on to receive various funding and support, and others have gone to become global players and even Unicorns. It is therefore, important to up-skill and retool the skillsets of bank supervisors and other players in ensuring they are well equipped to adequately regulate and supervise the evolving Fintech firms in their countries,” she said. The FITC boss explained that the programme presented a transparent and credible mechanism for Fintech regulators to provide all-inclusive, wide-ranging, and strategic approach to supervision of Fintech by approaching regulation from a structured system perspective that assesses risk exposures and gives priority to the resolution of risk. Malize noted that the African financial service sector ecosystem is awash with so many innovators and disruptors crisscrossing borders, challenging old habits, creating new thought processes, setting new standards, and diffusing talents across all sectors. Fintech is the disruptive technology driving start-ups and revolutionizing banking, payments, and insurance in today’s interconnected and competitive financial world. The programme, which is one of FITC’s intervention in the growth and development of the Fintech sub sector through increased knowledge content that fosters industry and regulators understanding and collaboration needed to drive and stimulate the industry’s growth, is part of the recommendations from FITC’s last FinTech Conference, TechNovate 2021, which recommended deeper learning, engagement and collaboration that would help advance the industry.
