Ibrahim Oyewale in Lokoja Senator Dino Melaye has vowed to mobilise millions of Nigerians against President Muhammadu Buhari if he failed to assent to the Electoral Amendment Bill. The Electoral Amendment Bill was transmitted to the president after being rejected for inclusion of some clauses that may likely create electoral crisis. Though feelers from the presidency has indicated that President Buhari may likely sign the electoral amendment bill today. But while speaking on the sideline of the Kogi State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stakeholders’ meeting in Lokoja yesterday, Melaye stated that he would personally mobilise millions of Nigerians against Buhari if the president failed to sign the bill. The senator, who represented Kogi West senatorial district at the National Assembly between 2015 and 2019, pointed out that the body language of the president showed that he was not interested in signing the bill. He added that the best way is to sign the electoral amendment bill to strengthened the electoral process and make the Nigeria elections more credible. Melaye maintained that the battle to retrieve Nigeria and Kogi State from the All Progressives Congress (APC) “is a battle of no retreat and no surrender.” He added that with the calibre of people who attended today (yesterday) stakeholders’ meeting has shown that the PDP is now ready to take seat of power from APC-led administrations of the state.
