“Honesty and transparency make you vulnerable. Be honest and transparent anyway” – Mother Teresa Telling the truth is the expected and usual way for most people even when it may not be the best option for them personally. This applies especially for our leaders who guide us and set the standards to follow. If only it was that simple though. There have been two recent cases, ex-President Trump, and ex-Prince Andrew and in both cases they have faced court challenges. Former President Trump and two of his children must testify in court into an investigation by the New York state attorney general into their business practices. He has also been investigated in relation to the Jan 6th Capital Hill riots although in both cases he has claimed his innocence, and this must be presumed correct unless there is more information made available that creates doubt. The recent court appeals to stop the investigation seems odd if there is nothing to be hidden and surely he would want the truth to be out there. With ex-Prince Andrew the matter has been into the courts, but a private and unknown settlement has resolved that matter. He has been accused of horrible things and has also always maintained his innocence as is his right although an open court procedure would have given him the opportunity to clear his name publicly. When people are honest, and their word is true then the best approach is to confront their doubters openly and resolve it in the court of public opinion rather than use a lawyer to attempt to stop legal court actions. Everyone should be brave and honest and stand up to defend what they have done and what they believe in. Dennis Fitzgerald,
