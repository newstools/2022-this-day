Former England midfielder Frank Lampard has been appointed Everton manager on a two-and-a-half-year deal. The 43-year-old replaces Rafael Benitez, who was sacked earlier this monthafter one win in 13 games. It is Lampard’s first job since he was sacked by Chelsea a year ago with Thomas Tuchel taking his role. “It is a huge honour for me to represent and manage a club with the size and tradition of Everton,” said Lampard. “I’m very hungry to get started.” Lampard’s first match in charge will be Saturday’s FA Cup fourth-round tie against Brentford at Goodison Park. His first signing at Everton is expected to be Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek, who is set to join the Toffees on loan for the rest of the season. Former Chelsea and Manchester City player Lampard, who won 106 caps for England, is tasked with keeping Everton in the top-flight as the club are 16th and just four points above the relegation zone. Lampard said he felt the “passion and ambition” of owner Farhad Moshiri, chairman Bill Kenwright and the Everton board in talks over the role. “I hope they felt my ambition and how hard I want to work to bring it together,” he added. “You can feel the passion Everton fans have for their club – that will be hugely important. “My first message to the players will be that we have to do this together. We’ll try to do our job and I know the fans will be there backing us.” Lampard was one of three candidates interviewed for the managerial position with Vitor Pereira and interim boss Duncan Ferguson also up for the role. Derby manager and former Everton and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney confirmed he was also asked about the job but he turned it down.
