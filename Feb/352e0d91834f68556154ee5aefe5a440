The senator representing Gombe Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly, Senator Muhammad Danjuma Goje, has launched distribution of foodstuffs to over 4,000 People Living With Disabilities (PLWDs) in his constituency.
The project tagged; ‘Zero Hunger,’ was meant to alleviate poverty among the vulnerable and people living with disability in the constituency, comprising Akko and Yamaltu/Deba LGAs.
Flagging off the distribution yesterday at his Gombe residence, Senator Goje, represented by Secretary of the Zero Hunger Scheme, Abubakar Sadiq Kurba, said over 4,390 PLWDs from the two LGAs are targeted
to benefit from the
exercise.
Kurba, who is member in the state House of Assembly, explained that each beneficiary would receive a plastic box containing rice; rice, beans, noodles, palm oil, groundnut oil, seasoning cubes, tomatoes paste and wrapper.
He added that the physically challenged were selected to benefit from the scheme, in order to bring succour to them being the most downtrodden members of the society.
“The senator targeted the disables because these people are in dire need of the food items, especially with the level of hunger and poverty that are prevalent in the state today,” he said.
The lawmaker stated that aside his empowerment initiatives, Senator Goje is facilitating federal projects in the constituency, “of recent is the proposed Federal Medical Centre and the ongoing construction of Model Primary School in Deba town.”
Responding on behalf of the beneficiaries, state chairman of PLWDs, Comrade Umar Ali Goro commended the senator for the gesture and urged all disabled to register and get voters cards so they could elect good representatives in the forthcoming elections.
Goro further sought for employment opportunities for the PLWDs in the state and establishment of special centre, to empower the physically challenged with vocational skills, “ to help our members become self-reliant.”
