The 2021/22 Season of the Edo Cricket League was rounded up at the weekend with Under-17 Cricket retaining the title they won last year with 62 runs win over Ambrose Alli University Cricket Club, Ekpoma. The U-17 team had led the eight-team league that bowled-off in December 2021 and was wrapped up with a two-day Super-Four that ran from Saturday February 12 to Sunday February 13, 2022. Ambrose Alli University Cricket Club edged Dolphins Cricket Club by six wickets on the opening day of the event, while No Limit Cricket Club fell by nine wickets to the U-17 side to set up the finals on Sunday. Uyi Akptata, the President of the Nigeria Cricket Federation who is also the Chairman of Edo State Cricket Club, said the two teams that played the finals gave good accounts of themselves. “This is the high point of the cricket development in the state and we are glad it has justified all the investment that everyone has put in,” stressed Akpata. Coach of the Under-17 team, Theophilus Ibodeme, said that though they were tipped to win, the huge task of getting the best of the youthful side meant that he will always have to be on hands to check on them because of their youthfulness. “ I am very grateful to God for the honour and I also praise the boys for being disciplined to keep the pace when they forged ahead in the first inning,” he said. Ibodeme stressed that the win has set the tone for a number of the players who will be part of the South-south team to the PwC National Under-17 Championship starting at the MKO Abiola National Stadium Abuja from Tuesday February 15, 2022.
