Francis Sardauna in Katsina Apparently miffed by the deteriorating state of its camp facilities in Katsina State, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has appealed to Governor Aminu Bello Masari to come to the aid of the scheme in the state. The State NYSC Coordinator, Ahidjo Yahaya, who made the appeal during the passing out ceremony of the 2021 Batch ‘A’ Corps members in the state, said the camp facilities were in dire need of renovation. Although, he said, the state government renovated some facilities in the camp in 2020, but male hostels and camp official’s quarters were still in a dilapidated stage. He said: “We thank the Katsina State government for the renovation work done on the female hostels. But we are still appealing to the government to carry out renovation work of the remaining camp facilities that were left out during the first face of renovation exercise in 2020. “We are calling on the governor to renovate the male corps members’ hostel and the already dilapidated camp officials’ quarters and provide an additional administrative block for efficiency and effectiveness in the execution of camp activities”. Ahidjo explained that a good number of camp officials sleeps outside the camp and that hindered their effectiveness in the discharge of their duties, saying the administrative block when provided will create offices for key camp officials According to him, “If the quarters are renovated, it will go a long way to help reduce the number of camp officials that sleep outside the camp during the orientation course.”
