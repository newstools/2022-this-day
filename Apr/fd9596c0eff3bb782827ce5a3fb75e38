 Kasim Sumaina in Abuja In a bid to ensure it remains a strong partner in the Nigerian healthcare sector and equip its members to function better in line with current economic realities, the Guild of Medical Directors will be organising a leadership summit in May this year. The President of the Guild of Medical Directors, Dr. Raymond Abiodun Kuti, who unveiled plans for the summit said the aim is to reposition, stimulate a vibrant and dynamic private sector able to withstand the current economic downturn and still deliver superlative healthcare. Kuti, who made the disclosure yesterday in Abuja, noted that the summit scheduled to hold next month will provide an opportunity for members to network as well as gain fresh insight through hands-on workshops and practical business sessions to take their practice to a new level. According to him, “The event’s aim is to among other things, bring Guild members in Nigeria together for more strategic engagements as the GMD needs to be at the table with government and its agencies when critical policy decisions are being made.” Kuti, however, urged owners of private hospitals to endeavour to attend as the summit will show them how to deliver uncompromised quality healthcare and at the same time, not compromise the health of their patients.
