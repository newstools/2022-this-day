The Mauritius-based Fund is jointly sponsored by AfricInvest Capital Partners and Cathay Innovation SAS.AfDB Director for Financial Sector Development, Stefan Nalletamby, in a statement, said, “The Bank’s approval signals the importance given to Africa’s tech-enabled rising entrepreneurs, as well as the significant role played by AfricInvest and Cathay Innovation in supporting this key business segment to achieve Africa’s growth, transformation and integration objectives.”The bank’s investment is expected to accelerate the creation of a new class of successful African entrepreneurs that will serve as a model to younger innovators. Through appropriate technology and innovation, it will also support youth and women-led startups and increase access and inclusion to financial and ‘real sector’ services and goods.
