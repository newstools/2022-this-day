HighLife Death brings many things to a close, dreams, aspirations, and a will to fix up the ailments of this aged world. Nevertheless, with every death is new life, and the show must go on. Senator Teslim Folarin is one person who sees the need for the living to go on living. And so, after the death of his old pal, the former Oyo State Governor, Adebayo Alao-Akala, Folarin is believed to have become the de facto leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo. Oyo politics has always been intriguing due to its strong but subtle insistence on political lineages. That is why it was so difficult for anybody to rise to the occasion when Abiola Ajimobi, former governor of the state and main voice in the APC, passed on. His lack of a successor threw the party off for a while. But Alao-Akala and Folarin were present to make things a bit more colourful, particularly with their competition to continue from where Ajimobi stopped. With the death of Alao-Akala, the number of people with a political pedigree to rival Folarin in Oyo can be numbered on one hand. As such, there are reports everywhere that he has become the uncontested leader of the APC in the state. These reports were particularly taken seriously during the recent convention as it was Folarin that essentially called the shots. But that is not all. More reports have begun to flow in regarding the direction of Folarin’s political career. It is alleged that now that he has the power to make and break in the APC Oyo quarters, the gubernatorial ticket is his for the taking. And why not? The last time he competed for the governorship seat was in 2014 and he lost to Ajimobi. Now, there is no Ajimobi and no Alao-Akala in Oyo APC – only Folarin.
