 Seriki Adinoyi The Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) yesterday condemned the recent massacre of over 100 citizens in Kanam Local Government Area, Plateau State. NGF, a non-partisan platform created to enhance collaboration among the governors, donated N50 million to the victims of the recent massacre in Plateau State. The Chairman of the Forum, Dr. Kayode Fayemi revealed the figure at the Government House, Rayfield Jos on behalf of all the governors of the federation. Fayemi, also the governor of Ekiti State, condemned the gruesome murder of the innocent citizens by the terrorists, saying this was another attempt to destroy the efforts put in by the Lalong administration to consolidate peace and security in the state. He said the forum was outraged over the killings and would continue to do everything possible to support Lalong to overcome the situation and deal with those who are bent on causing chaos in his state known to be a natural destination of choice to many. He, therefore, announced a donation of N50 million to assist in meeting the needs of victims and supporting those who are displaced, also condoling Lalong over the death of the Statistician General of the Federation, Dr. Simon Harry, who died recently. In his response, Lalong said he was delighted to receive the chairman of the forum who has come on behalf of the other governors to commiserate with the people and government of the state. He said the state was devastated by the incident, which was sheer criminality and a desperate attempt by merchants of crises to take the state back to the dark days. Lalong assured that the government has beefed up security and also directed that all those involved be arrested and brought to justice. He thanked the forum for the donation and specifically commended Fayemi for his leadership, which he described as pragmatic, compassionate and focused.
