HighLife The National Convention for the All Progressives Congress (APC) has come and gone and brought with it new changes. Some of the top personalities of the party have been ‘encouraged’ to take the backseat while others have been placed close enough to the pilot to steer the plane from time to time. Senator Iyiola Omisore is one of the latter and appears to be on the rise from now on. The APC national convention saw a multitude of the party’s powerbrokers ready to cut each other’s throats for the top positions. These very experienced powerbrokers engaged in a match of wits and influenced and shuffled the cards of leadership to place this person in this position and that person in that. Omisore, for all the unfavourable tidings about him this past year, came out on top. Based on the decision of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu emerged as the National Chairman and Omisore was confirmed as the National Secretary. And while this selection appears to be willy nilly, the informed among us are doubtless aware that Omisore came from the very bottom of the pot to reign supreme. Many people have switched political parties in recent times. Their intention is clear, and that is to join the winning party and earn themselves some spots for the future. Omisore was the same a bit over a year ago. Look where that got him—the number two position in the APC. But that is more a reflection of Omisore’s prestige rather than luck or extremely precise political calculations. Before his new position, there were still murmurs of Omisore’s last tango with several scary Nigerian institutions. In short, this is a new lease on life for the Osun man. With such leases, the future is generally full of endless opportunities. And so it is for Omisore.
