Mastercard Foundation and Trace have launched a new learning application to enable 26 million young Africans to acquire on-demand market-relevant skills.The mobile-based app, Trace Academia is free-to-use and interactive, and tested in four African countries.The learning content will include technical courses relevant to 15 different industries such as technology, energy, beauty, fashion, Do it yourself (DIY), digital marketing, hospitality, the creative arts, journalism, and film, as well as courses that are more broadly relevant. Each course featured on the application has been designed in collaboration with an industry-leading organisation to ensure its relevance to employers and the job market.Users can access courses in both English and French, with Portuguese-language courses to be launched soon.The chief programme officer, Peter Materu, said the Mastercard Foundation is pleased to support the platform as part of the Young Africa Works strategy to enable 30 million young people to access dignified and fulfilling work by 2030.“The platform offers young people total flexibility and control over their learning. Users can learn at their own pace, in their own time, and customise their journey to the emergent demands they face as they navigate the world of work. Secondly, the courses are deeply practical and designed in collaboration with market-leading organisations to ensure they are industry-relevant,” he said.” TECH PERSONALITY OF THE WEEKMaya Horgan FamoduThis week’s tech personality is the founder and partner at Ingressive Capital, Maya Horgan Famodu.
