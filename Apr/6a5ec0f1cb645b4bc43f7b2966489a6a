 Seriki Adinoyi in Jos As part of his strategies to spread his tentacles across the state, front line gubernatorial aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau State and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bagudu Hirse, has inaugurated campaign coordinators across the 17 local government areas. Charging the coordinators to reach out to delegates in the localities and produce the desired results during the primaries, the Director General of Bagudu Hirse Campaign Organisation, Hon Ezekiel Iza, said the campaign office expected nothing short of that from them, urging them to do everything to promote Hirse’s aspiration. He noted that all of them were recommended by respected critical stakeholders of the PDP from their various LGAs, stressing that the bulk of the job of reaching out to and mobilising delegates was with them. Iza urged them to collaborate with party stakeholders and respective zonal coordinators of the campaign organisation ahead of the proposed tour of the 17 LGAs by Hirse to mobilise support as the days draw closer to gubernatorial primaries. While responding, the coordinators took turns to express appreciation to the aspirant for trusting in their capabilities to deliver on the job, promising not to betray the trust reposed in them. Iza immediately sent them forth, cautioning them to work with time and bring results. Hirse had submitted his form at the Wadata Plaza National Secretariat of PDP, insisting that he’s the candidate to beat in Plateau State, as he assured the state that he would domesticate his wealth of experience in taking the state out of the woods.
