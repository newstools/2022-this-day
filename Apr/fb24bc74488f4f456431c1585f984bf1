 Gilbert Ekugbe Henkel Nigeria has stated that through its Researchers’ World (Forscherwelt) programme, it is targeting to expose a huge number of Nigerian children into the fascinating world of science. In a statement issued to THISDAY, Henkel stated with the initiative, it strives to be at the forefront of supporting governmental programmes, such as the country’s education ambitions. “Henkel will not only continue to be a strong contributor to the Nigerian economy by empowering young talents through Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), but also drive and amplify its involvement in community relations, “he said. According to Henkel, since its inauguration at Henkel’s Düsseldorf headquarters in April 2011, more than 62,000 children around the world have taken part in Henkel’s Researcher’s World programmes. Forscherwelt’s global coordinator, Dr. Ute Krupp remarked that Researcher’s World gives young children all over the world a fascinating introduction into the world of science and what it means to be a researcher through the hands-on teaching methodology. For the coordinator, Girls and Women Technological Empowerment Organisation (GWTEO), Damilola Asaleye, the non-governmental organization executing the Researcher’s World training in Nigeria, said the mode of learning will produce future citizens that are more resilient and persistent in solving societal problems instead of shying away from challenges.
