 Like the typical Okrika man and African elders, the late Pa Clement Genesis Chepaka populated his household and built a great family. The ace television producer had an unflinching love for his immediate family, his Okrika culture and the entire people of the kingdom. As he advanced in age, one of his several heart desires was to be survived by a family who would give him a befitting burial at his home whenever he transited to glory. Today, his wish is surely coming to pass, as his funeral has been fixed by his family and his daughter, Nigeria’s High Commissioner to Jamaica, Dr. Maureen Tamuno. The High Commissioner and philanthropist, it was gathered, will spare no expenses to make the event a memorable one that will be spoken of for a long time to come. The historic town of Okrika in the Okrika Local Government Area of Rivers State is expected to stand still for days while the celebrations last. Many who know the beautiful woman understand that she does not do anything in half measures. For someone like Ambassador Tamuno who has continually sown good seeds of friendships and is loved for her benevolence and humanity, it is no surprise that friends and fans have started gifting her massive donations towards the burial. According to a close source, top politicians, celebrities, socialites, diplomats and first-class kings, amongst others, have already written to confirm their attendance at the funeral coming up soon. The funeral arrangement will begin with an evening of tributes on Tuesday, April 26 at the Reens Arena in Port Harcourt; the funeral service and interment will take place at Saint Peter Cathedral Okrika, while the reception will be held at Everest Centre also in Okrika. The late patriarch, who died at the ripe age of  93 in January, was a media practitioner and producer with the Rivers State Ministry of Information. He was a  statesman, a custodian of history and tradition and a disciplinarian to boot.
