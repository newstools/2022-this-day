 Super Eagles invitee Michael Olise faces a fitness test to make Crystal Palace’s matchday squad for Sunday’s Emirates FA Cup semifinal clash against Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. The France U21 international certainly wants to be involved in the match against Chelsea and the primary reason is because of his past connections with the Stamford Bridge outfit, having spent time at their academy before making the switch to Reading. Olise picked up a foot injury while on international duty with the France U21s late last month and has missed the last two games played by the Eagles in the Premier League. There’s a little bit of good news regarding the availability of Olise for Sunday’s fixture, with Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira revealing at today’s press conference that the winger has returned to training. Speaking to reporters, Vieira stated : “We had Tyrick and Michael who had some training on the field, individually yesterday, a little bit more today. “And then of course we have to wait tomorrow to see if there is any kind of reaction, but they will only get involved in the game if they are one hundred percent fit.” Statistically, Olise has been Crystal Palace’s most influential player in this season’s FA Cup, scoring twice and registering three assists in four appearances. Vieira, who won the competition four times during his playing days, is unbeaten in his last nineteen matches in the FA Cup as a player and coach.
