 The Enugu State Council of Traditional Rulers has cautioned its members who indulge in partisan politics or take sides with individuals or groups in political contests, to henceforth desist from such activities which contravene Section 10 of Enugu State Traditional Rulers Law, or be ready to face the consequences. In a statement by the Chairman, Enugu State Council of Traditional Rulers, HM Igwe Lawrence Agubuzu, the Council “viewed with very grave concern the conduct and activities of some royal fathers who have failed to adhere to our primary role and responsibility for peace, order, security and welfare of our dear Enugu State”. Igwe Agubuzu disclosed that the re-affirmation of the Traditional Rulers’ position as “apolitical royal fathers who are not expected to involve ourselves in partisan politics or to take side with individuals or groups of our subjects in political contestations” was one of the resolutions passed by the General Assembly of the State recognized Traditional Rulers at their meeting in Enugu, on Tuesday, March 29, 2022. The Chairman, who pointed out that the caution became necessary to ensure that a few Traditional Rulers among them do not tarnish the image of the entire revered royal fathers of Enugu State, stated that “the State Council of Traditional Rulers will compile and forward to our State Government, for scrutiny and sanction where appropriate, the names of Traditional Rulers who choose to contravene Section 10 of the Enugu State Traditional Rulers Law”.
