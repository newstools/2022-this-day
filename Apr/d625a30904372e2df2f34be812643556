 Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The Chartered Institute of Export and Commodity Brokers of Nigeria (CIECBN) has kicked against the “National Conference on Non-oil Export” that is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, April 27, 2022, which is the 26th of Ramadan 1443 AH by the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC). The NEPC is organising the two-day conference, which is expected to be a convergence of multi-sectoral stakeholders and practitioners to express, collate and articulate positions on emerging issues relating to non-oil exports. But a statement that was issued in Kano yesterday by the Regional Director (North) of CIECBN, Mr. Rabiu Kazaure, said that the dates for the conference were deliberately slated to bar most Muslims from participating in the conference. Kazaure said: “As far as we are concerned the dates for the conference has been slated without taking into cognisance that most Muslims participants will be traveling from all over the north to Abuja under the condition of fasting, harsh weather and within the last ten days of Ramadan, which are precious and dedicated to religious devotions while many have traveled to Saudi Arabia for lesser Hajj as well.” He noted that even the governor of Jigawa State, who would be the guest of honor at the conference, would not make it as he would travel to Saudi Arabia for lesser Hajj (Umrah). “In the light of the above, we deemed it necessary to write to the relevant authorities and all stakeholders to draw their attention to this matter of importance so as to kindly consider adjusting the date to a more appropriate date, which will give all Nigerians a chance to participate and contribute their quota in non-oil export conference. “The objective of the conference is to create a plethora of opportunities for stakeholders to have a robust conversation on current and emerging global issues and articulate innovative solutions towards expediting sustainable non-oil export trade. So, how can this be achieved when most of the participants cannot make it,” Kazaure said.
