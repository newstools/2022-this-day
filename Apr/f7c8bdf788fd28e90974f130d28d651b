 Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant in Katsina State,Yusuf Salisu Majigiri, has vowed to rescue the state from alleged misrule by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government of Governor Aminu Bello Masari in 2023 if he is elected governor of the state. Majigiri, who spoke in Mashi when he received the expression of interest and nomination forms purchased for him by some PDP bigwigs in the state, said he was on a mission to return Katsina State to its lost glory. According to him, “We are on a mission to rescue Katsina State from the current mess, occasioned by the misrule of the All Progressives Congress-led government of Governor Aminu Masari since 2015.” He stressed that the APC administration in the state has jettisoned all the life-changing policies and programmes of late Umaru Musa Yar’Adua and Ibrahim Shehu Shema and brought untold hardship to the citizenry. He said the security and economic challenges besetting the state would be tackled within the first hundred days of his administration if elected as the governor of the state in the forthcoming polls. Majigiri added that he would ensure that all the internally displaced persons (IDPs), especially farmers, who were sacked by terrorists from their ancestral homes, are returned and the schools closed as a result of insecurity will be opened. The guber aspirant assured residents of the state of sustainable security, economy and educational policies, employment, empowerment and good agricultural programmes that will enhance food sufficiency in the state. Majigiri, who is the current chairman of the main opposition party, noted that women and youths would not be neglected by his prospective government because of their role in societal development.
