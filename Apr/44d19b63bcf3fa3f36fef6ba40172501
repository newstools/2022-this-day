Segun James The former Publicity Secretary of the All  Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Joe Igbokwe has advised anyone who graduated from the Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s political school should consider not contesting the presidency with the leader.Igbokwe, who said this at the prayer meeting of the Indomitable Tinubu Support Organisation (ITSO), explained that anyone who has passed through this school and has governed Lagos State has the capacity to govern Nigeria,  insisted, however, that  the leader should have the chance of first refusal. “I’m a graduate of this school and I know the value. For this reason, I’m a Nigerian and proudly so. Hence, we cannot trust our country to the hands of someone without experience, a mediocre. Let me make it clear, anyone who has ruled Lagos can rule Nigeria,” he said.Igbokwe, who is the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Drainages, said that if the nation is to take its place in the comity of nations, Tinubu should be allowed to take the saddle as president of Nigeria.“The only leader we know that is capable of taking Nigeria to the next level is Asiwaju. He’s a teacher on matters of governance. We need to use him now. I know the number of leaders he has built,” he stressed.Earlier, the chairman of the event, Prince Anofi Elegushi, had said that while others were sleeping and waiting on others to anoint them, Tinubu who is said to be infirm has been going around the country building bridges across the political divides in the country.He said that it is this rare gift that put Tinubu in the best stead to lead the country in this most critical period of the country.Also speaking, the Director General of ITSO, Ladi Balogun, said that a Tinubu presidency will bring prosperity to the nation, adding that he has the capacity to tackle the insecurity plaguing the country.Balogun stressed that the APC national leader should be allowed to re-engineer the national economy as he did with Lagos.
