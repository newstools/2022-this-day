This conflict has significantly impacted energy prices, broader inflation, supply chains and consumer spending.” He said he was pleased that the telecoms company made significant strides in deepening relationships with all its stakeholders while substantially enhancing its contributions to government revenue. “In recognition of our remarkable performance in remittance of taxes despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) recognised MTN Nigeria as a top 20 taxpayer and one of the best tax compliant organisations in Nigeria for the 2021 tax year. “In terms of strategic milestones, we concluded the first phase of a series of transactions to increase Nigerian ownership in MTN Nigeria, and we are delighted to have welcomed 126,720 retail investors to our shareholder base, many of whom are first-time investors.

We will launch our 5G services once regulatory approval is obtained. “Post the reporting period, we were granted final approval for our MoMo Payment Service Bank (PSB) by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This will enable us to offer financial services in line with the CBN’s guidelines and support the government in fulfilling its agenda of driving financial inclusion in Nigeria,” he said. Toriola added:” Although our mobile subscriber base declined by 1.9 per cent  YoY from 71.5 million in March 2021 to 70.2 million, we sustained the growth trajectory from Q4 2021 as we ramp up capacity for SIM registration and NIN enrolment. As a result, we added 1.7 million subscribers in Q1 2022. In addition, active data subscribers rose by 10.5 per cent YoY to 35.9 million, with 1.6 million added in Q1 as we continued to drive data conversion from our new and existing subscriber base. “To enable the growth in subscribers and traffic, we continued to enhance the capacity of our network. In doing so, we frontloaded our capex plan for the year, deploying capex of N162.5 billion in the period to accommodate the sustained demand for data and accelerate the rollout of our 4G network, which now covers approximately 72 per cent of the population and accounts for 76 per cent of data traffic.” He further said that the financial performance in the quarter was underpinned by strong commercial momentum, driving growth across its key revenue lines.”Service revenue grew by 22 per cent, in line with our medium-term growth guidance of ‘at least 20 per cent. This was led by growth in data and supported by voice, fintech and digital services,” Toriola said.
