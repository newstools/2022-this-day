 The Managing Director of DMO Travels and Media Concept Deborah Oyebolu is stepping up her creativity game with a blockbuster movie that is set to raise the bar of movie production in Nollywood. The multimillion Naira movie, titled ‘Ceeci’ is produced by DMO Media Concept and seeks to raise awareness on the plight of children raised in teacher-parent homes. The story is based on the real-life story of D Oyebolu, who grew up in a stern but loving company of teacher-parents who didn’t spare the rod and raised a champion. The film highlights the disadvantages of undue parental pressures and hasty condemnation that often affect the confidence and career path of children not showing early signs of academic brilliance. With this movie, Oyebolu is making her debut in Nollywood. It stars Adunni Ade, Bukky Ogunnote, and Yemi Solade among others. The film directed by the trio of Sesan Alabi, Bororo, and Bukola Salami is set for theatrical release soon.
