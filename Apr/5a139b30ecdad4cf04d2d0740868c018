 Wole Ayodele Four days after a bomb blast killed six people at Iware cattle market in Ardo Kola Local Government Area of Taraba State, another bomb blast yesterday rocked Jalingo, the state capital. The blast occured at exactly 8.00p.m. at a local drinking spot behind the old Catholic Church in Nukkei area of the metropolis. Though no life was lost in the blast, two people (a woman and a child) sustained serious injuries and have been taken to the Federal Medical Centre, Jalingo, for treatment. A resident of the area, Dan Azumi told THISDAY that the bomb exploded shortly after those drinking at the spot dispersed to their various homes. According to him, “The explosion occurred at the burukutu joint close to the house of the Mai Angwar, Chief John Awoshiri and it was not up to five minutes after the people at the joint dispersed when the bomb exploded. “We thank God that nobody died but two people sustained injuries while a motorcycle that was parked close to the joint was destroyed including the fence of the next building,” he stated. All efforts to speak with the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Ibrahim Usman, proved abortive as he did not respond to calls to his mobile line. A bomb that exploded a burukutu spot at Iware cattle market on Teusday had killed six people and left several others injured. A terrorist group Islamic State of West Africa (ISWAP) had on Thursday claimed responsibility for the Iware blast
