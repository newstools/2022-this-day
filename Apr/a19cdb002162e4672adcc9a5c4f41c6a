HighLife Things are getting hot again in Edo State. Adams Oshiomhole, the one-time gladiator of the All Progressives Congress (APC), clocked 70 a few days ago. After dancing his heart out with his very fine wife by his side, the man revealed that he has his heart set on returning to the political ring. In short, the coming months are going to be exhilarating for outsiders, while insiders might just tremble once and again at the continued clash between the old and the new. For many newcomers to political life in Nigeria, figures like Oshiomhole, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and even former President Olusegun Obasanjo, are the real deal-the real hegemony that determines the dynamics of who rules and reigns in the country. In Edo State, Oshiomhole’s position is unrivaled and unparalleled anywhere else. Or it used to be. Nevertheless, this might change soon enough. A few weeks ago, the powers that be in the media informed the public that Oshiomhole has started making moves to join his other brothers in the senatorial march. During a meeting in his hometown, Oshiomhole told his family, friends, and associates that he intends to represent Edo North District on the Senate floor. Thus, former Edo Governor Oshiomhole would become Senator Oshiomhole, following the tradition of other godfathers like Tinubu. As Oshiomhole is a master of politics and strategy, his decision undoubtedly came about after much deliberation. However, the fact that he dared to declare his senatorial ambition means that he is certain that he stands a chance at the position. But others might wonder how he expects to win anything with his arch-rival, Governor Godwin Obaseki, still in power. Regardless of anybody’s reservations, the fact that Oshiomhole is back on the political block is positively exhilarating. Finally, someone that knows how to play the game with finesse.
