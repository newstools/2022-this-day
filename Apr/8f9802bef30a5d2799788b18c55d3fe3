 Wale Igbintade The ongoing trial of Chidinma Ojukwu, the alleged murderer of late Super TV Chief Executive Officer, Usifo Ataga, at the Lagos State High Court was stalled yesterday following dispute over the admissibility of Ataga’s bank statements. Ojukwu is facing trial for murder, stealing and forgery alongside Adedapo Quadri and Chioma  Ebuchu  before Justice Yetunde Adesanya. At the proceedings yesterday, two representatives from Access Bank and GTCO appeared in court to tender statements of account of the deceased as evidential documents. However, Onwuka Egwu, counsel to the first defendant, Ojukwu, objected to the tendering of Access Bank statement of account, arguing that the document came as a surprise. In the same vein, Babatunde Busari, counsel to the second defendant, Adedapo Quadri, also objected to the Access Bank statement on the ground that it was different from the account details already tendered to the court as an exhibit. Consequently, the Lagos State Deputy Director of Public Prosecution (DDPP), A. O. Oluwafemi, prayed the court for an adjournment to enable her put her house in order. The matter has been adjourned till today, April 26, 2022, for continuation of trial.
