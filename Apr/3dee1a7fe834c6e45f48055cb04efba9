 Say what you will about equality in the human race, kings and queens are made different. Their royal majesties customarily  adorn themselves in colours so brilliantly colourful that they put peacocks and rainbows to shame. Yet, even among this colorful lot, Oba Saheed Ademola Elegushi is different. In this 21st Century, there aren’t a lot of truly traditional monarchs around. But Oba Elegushi, Kusenla III, grand lord of the Ikate-Elegushi Kingdom, wears this title with such fantastic stylishness that all the others that came before him appear to have worn workers’ uniforms in comparison. Indeed, many kings there sit on earthly thrones, but the Elegushi’s kingship cannot be placed near these. Nigerians tend to overdo things, and the people of the South-west are even more outrageous when they want to be. Elegushi is the most stylish king to walk the lands of the South-west, cast his eyes towards the East and North, and raise the bars of fashion and fascination. It may be because he has the roots for it, descending from the bluest of blue blood from the Kusenla Ruling House. Or it might be innate as it is generally believed since he was stylish even before ascending the throne. Have you seen the Elegushi at a high-octane event? Once he passes through a section of the place, it is as though a perfect riot of colours has walked past. Such style is it that even the most conservative and soul-satisfied person would sigh in amazement and envy. Indeed, there are some destined to walk the earth like rainbows, reminding the rest of us that there is such a thing as luxury and splendor. This is a summary of Elegushi’s lifestyle. And it all fits him. It fits him oh so well.
