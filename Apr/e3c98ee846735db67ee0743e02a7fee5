As Christians and Muslims, it is very important that we emulate the good virtues of Jesus Christ for our society to fare better.“So as we celebrate this Easter, I implore us all to spread love, preach peace and scatter seeds of kindness and happiness everywhere around us. Let’s be tolerant of one another irrespective of our religious, tribal and political differences. Above all, let’s be fair in our utterances and dealings with one another.“Importantly as the 2023 general election beckons, we must not allow any politician to use us irresponsibly or callously to fulfil their political ambition or interest at the detriment of the overall interest of our dear country. We must not allow ourselves to be used as an instrument for division and violence. It is time we jettison the political godfathersim but focus on building strong institutions that the generation yet unborn will be proud of. Once again,  Happy Easter to all of us.”
