 Prospective Chelsea buyers the Ricketts family have moved to ease supporters’ concerns about their stance on certain social issues as they look to complete a takeover at Stamford Bridge. Headed by siblings Laura and Tom, the Ricketts are one of four final bidders vying to assume control of the club from oligarch Roman Abramovich, who put his prized asset up for sale before sanctions were imposed on him by the UK government following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the Chicago Cubs owners’ interest has drawn a backlash from the Chelsea fanbase due to historic Islamophobic remarks from family patriarch Joe and recent anti-abortion comments from brother Pete, who is governor of Nebraska. The hashtag ‘#NoToRicketts’ has been trending on Twitter, and a small protest was organised ahead of the home defeat to Brentford on Saturday. The Ricketts, who are backed by American billionaire Ken Griffin, have been in London recently for talks and meetings with stakeholders. The family has already outlined eight pledges to the Chelsea fanbase should their bid be successful, and now Laura Ricketts has given a lengthy statement in an attempt to reassure supporters of their stance on some key issues.
