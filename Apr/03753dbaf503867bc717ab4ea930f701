HighLife A man may be described as a piece of brick, hard and stinky, but no woman has been described as such. Instead, even the harshest poet would claim that a woman is a pearl or piece of a precious stone that is one thing or another. With Florence, the wife of late Oyo Governor, Senator Isiaka Abiola Ajimobi, the label of precious stone or jewel of inestimable price is not superfluous. At 63, she is still a champion of the family, loved and respected by all and sundry. There is a level of esteem that Chief Florence has come to be associated with. Ever since her husband passed away, the former First Lady of Oyo State has done all her best to hold the Abiola family together. Many times, the fractures over which she stood as manager extended to the political party over which her late husband was a hegemon. Even so, Chief Florence maintained an immovable heart, untouched by treasures and invulnerable to threats. A few days ago, the 62nd birthday of Chief Florence rang out with all the pitch that it could muster. People from all over the country took time out to hail her, telling her to take things easy as she covers for her late husband. Alas, it was clear to them that whereas Chief Florence appreciated their goodwill, it did little good. Florence has always tried her best to manage the Ajimobi family. However, what makes the eyes of observers bulge out is that she isn’t doing badly as she commands some of the generals of the All Progressives Congress (APC). And these generals do not only listen to her because of the prestige of her late husband but because she is wholly committed to the cause of the people. Although voices are claiming that Florence is not qualified and someone else is, it is clear that Florence has a good grasp of the APC in Oyo and will be using this grasp as soon as she can. She might have set her eyes on a senatorial position. Thus, her way may not be the easiest to follow, but she is sure that she will live brightly and brilliantly.
