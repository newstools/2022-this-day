The former national chairman of the party added that the support of the women is really needed if one wants to go far in Nigerian politics especially when one is seeking for a political position. He commended the women for coming out from their shells to seek political relevance and hold political offices in the country. Earlier in her remark, Mrs  Dame Omua-Okpaku said the women’s conference is timely and pungent, stating that some of the issues to be raised and debated at the conference would also have bearing on the rights and privileges of women being currently discussed in the national assembly.
