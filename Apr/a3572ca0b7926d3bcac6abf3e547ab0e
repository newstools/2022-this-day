According to the REC, “It is a violation of the law to conduct primaries outside the constituencies for which parties are nominating candidates.” Madami declared that the commission would not monitor such primaries conducted outside the constituency, and their outcome will not be accepted. He said: “Political parties are enjoined to avoid acrimonious primaries that could result in unnecessary litigations that may lead to failure to nominate, and field candidates for elections in some constituencies.” The REC advised political parties to adhere strictly to the principles of internal democracy drawn from their constitutions, guidelines, the Electoral Act, and other guidelines and regulations issued by INEC. “Where a political party fails to comply with the provisions of the Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidates shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue,” the REC said. He commended political parties in the state for their cooperation with INEC, and assured them that the commission was ready to conduct peaceful, fair and acceptable elections in 2023.
