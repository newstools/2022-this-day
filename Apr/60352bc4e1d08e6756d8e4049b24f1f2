 Yinka Olatunbosun Excel Signature is set to present an exhibition “Moods Relic of Courage,” a contemporary art exhibition by Jude Olotu. The exhibition is scheduled to hold from April 10 to 18 at the Thought Pyramid Art Centre, Abuja. Olotu in recent years has exhibited internationally including New York and France showcasing his unique style of eclectic art. He has participated in group and individual exhibitions in Nigeria. His entry into the international space was welcomed with accolades from the international community and peers at the just concluded World Art Dubai exhibition. It was a case of a bitter sweet experience as it was a marvel to behold the genius in his strokes however the non-sale campaign left curators and art lovers thirsty. The genius of Olotu has created and nurtured many talents and students of the arts which has led to the creation of the Excel Signature Creative Hub in Abuja Nigeria. The artist who hails from the Niger Delta developed his love for art as a child, growing up in Jos.
