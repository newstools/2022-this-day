 Sunday Aborisade in Abuja A former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, Saturday expressed concern over the unabated insecurity in Nigeria and lamented that the unfortunate situation has demystified the country as a great nation.Ekweremadu stated this in a goodwill message to the Christian faithful at Easter.He said only peace built on justice and love could guarantee the much-needed development and lasting security in the nation. Part of the goodwill message read: “It pains in particular to watch as our nation is daily demystified by the mounting insecurity, poverty and multi-sectorial regression. “We can still and should indeed resurrect the giant in Nigeria by pulling together, promoting and imbibing the virtues of justice, forgiveness and love needed to build a peaceful, united, secure and prosperous nation.”Ekweremadu enjoined Nigerians to tread the path of love, justice and peace in their relationship with one another to engender national cohesion and development.The senator said: “Easter is a thought-provoking moment as it commemorates the triumph of love, forgiveness and self-sacrifice over hate and evil. “Unfortunately, Nigeria has not lived up to the promises she held at independence due partly to systemic injustice as well as ethno-religious and sectional discriminations and recriminations that have combined to slow down the nation’s match to greatness.”While wishing Nigerians a hitch-free Easter celebration, Ekweremadu urged them to also cease the occasion to pray for the nation.
