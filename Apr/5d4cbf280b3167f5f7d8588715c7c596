 Duro Ikhazuagbe Nigerian international, Moses Simon, was on Tuesday nominated for the Marc Vivien Foe Award 2022 in the French Ligue 1. The prestigious award instituted in memory of the fallen Cameroonian player is awarded to the most outstanding African player in the topflight French Ligue 1. Foe died in active service in 2003 aged 28 years.
