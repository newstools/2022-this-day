HighLife Posterity has been described as one of the aims of marriage and marital commitment. The idea is that two people come together to birth someone that would continue their legacy. For the family of Daddy GO, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, this responsibility to nurture the next generation seems to have gone a bit awry with their youngest son, Leke Adeboye. It has been a while since RCCG got cast into a sea of controversy, but Leke’s recent action accomplished exactly this. According to the last-born son of the great man, every RCCG pastor who went up to the lectern to preach last Sunday (April 3, 2022) after his father did on a national broadcast is a goat. This is the narrative in context: RCCG has a custom of having Daddy GO (Adeboye) preach the only sermon on the first Sunday of every month because it is a Thanksgiving Service. This sermon is broadcast to every other RCCG parish in the country and outside. After this, the trend is to move on to other things rather than add anything to what Daddy GO has said. And this is what Leke meant: whoever climbed up the altar in any RCCG parish to preach an additional sermon after his father’s sermon is a goat. Leke’s comment has caused a deluge of dissatisfaction to rise against the Adeboye family, with many people calling out Daddy GO to caution his son and Senior Personal Assistant. Others have begun drawing parallels between Leke and the sons of Prophet Eli in the Bible who refused to follow in the steps of their father but took advantage of his position to cause havoc. Curiously, neither Daddy GO nor his wife, Madam Foluke, have said a thing about their son’s comment. This has only increased the censure against the church especially since—as others have said—this is not the first time that Leke is inadvertently dragging RCCG in the mud.
