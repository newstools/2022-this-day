HighLife  There are people; great and small. Erelu Toyin Saraki, the wife of former Senate President Bukola Saraki, has made a name for herself and is undoubtedly one of the greatest individuals in the country. Despite her high status, she has a lovable personality and so she’s well-liked among the grassroots and top-flyers in the country. The grace and charm of Erelu Saraki are unlike any other. She is a person who has reason on her side and passion in her corner. As a global health advocate, healthcare philanthropist, and the Founder-President of Wellbeing Foundation Africa (WBFA), she has a prestige that’s almost reminiscent of ancient African queens. There is much to say about the personality of Erelu Bobajiro of the Oniru Kingdom. Her background is spectacular, but that is not all there is to her. The fact that she has become a titled character in a kingdom as top-class as Oniru demonstrates that Erelu Saraki has exceeded her peers in many respects. Many people know that Erelu Saraki is a notable personality when it comes to philanthropy and the welfare of women and children in Nigeria. As the president and founder of WBFA, her reach is so far out of the country that she is a continental phenomenon. After all, there are very few people who care about such things as newborn and child health, gender-based discrimination and violence, socio-economic empowerment so as to do something about it. But Erelu Saraki is much more than that. She is always supportive of her friends, regardless of how busy she is. Her busy schedule has never stopped her from socialising with friends and associates. You can invite her on a Thursday and expect her to be there on a Saturday. Thus, her grace and charm remain unparalleled among her peers.
