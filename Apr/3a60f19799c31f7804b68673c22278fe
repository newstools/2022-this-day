 Relegation-bound Watford is looking to swoop in for Nigeria-eligible striker Michael Obafemi from Swansea as they look to reshape for life in the Championship. The former Southampton man has had a brilliant campaign with the Swans, and Watford are looking to recruit him as part of plans for Championship football. The Hornets are 19th on the Premier League table and will likely drop to the Championship with five games left to play. If they eventually go down, they could lose some of their top stars in the summer. Ismaila Sarr, Moussa Sissoko, and Emmanuel Dennis are some of the players on their way out of Vicarage Road. Watford would look to replace their departures, and according to Hertslive, they are looking to snap up Obafemi from Swansea to replace Dennis. Obafemi has been impressive for the Swans since he left Southampton last summer. The Nigeria-eligible striker has 11goals and three assists in 30 appearances. The Dublin-born forward has pace, and he could be an excellent bargain at €2million. Obafemi was born in Dublin to Nigerian parents, and he has one cap for Ireland. However, he is eligible to play for Nigerian according to FIFA rules.
