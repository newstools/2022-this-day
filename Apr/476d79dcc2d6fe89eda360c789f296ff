 Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo Confusion erupted yesterday at Osun State High Court sitting in Osogbo after second defendant, Ms. Magdalene Chiefuna, in the case of the murder of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Post Graduate Student, Mr. Timothy Adegoke, slumped moments after she was called into the dock. But it took the intervention of the court clerk, warders and some people in the court to avert what seemed like an unfolding tragedy. She was later taken out of the dock to a seat. The incident prompted her defense counsel, to ask the court for an adjournment. Meanwhile, the Presiding Judge, Justice Adepele Ojo, stood down the case. It would be recalled that the matter was slated for defendants to open their defence today following the closing of prosecution case in March. When the trial resumed around 9:05a.m., both the defence and the state counsels were arguing over the propriety of handing over the case to Human Rights Lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), who was in court, when the second defendant suddenly slumped. However Justice Ojo quickly adjourned the matter shortly to allow the defendant to be attended to.
