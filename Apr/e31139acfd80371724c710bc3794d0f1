 Digital services provider, Globacom, has felicitated with Nigerians as they join other Christians worldwide to celebrate this year’s Easter. In a goodwill message sent by the company over the weekend in Lagos, Globacom sued for peace which, according to the network, is the fulcrum of the Christian faith. It said that Christ offered himself as propitiation for the sins of the world and he lived a life which made Him an eternal exemplar of peace on earth and goodwill to men. According to the company, Christ preached love towards mankind. His ‘love thy neighbour as thyself’ sermon has been adjudged one of the shortest but most profound teachings by which man can dwell without rancor with others. “If we all embrace this teaching, the ills in our society will be greatly reduced, if not totally eradicated,” Globacom opined, adding that Jesus Christ sacrificing himself for the sins of mankind is the greatest act of love ever known. The company called on Christians to extend the same love Christ demonstrated in their dealings with others. The network promised unhindered voice, data and Short Messaging Service (SMS) during and after the Easter celebrations while encouraging subscribers to avail themselves of the various data and voice offerings on the network.
