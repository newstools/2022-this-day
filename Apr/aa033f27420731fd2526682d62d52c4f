It has consistently demonstrated resilience in the face of macro-economic headwinds and recorded remarkable growth, even in face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank’s traditional commitment to grow local industries got a boost as loans and advances to the its numerous customers rose from N748.9 billion in 2020 to N779.29 billion in 2021. The increased support for industries in 2021 was consistent with its mandate to transform Nigeria’s industrial sector by providing long-term financing and counter-cyclical loans diversified across industries such as agro-processing, gender businesses and renewable energy among others. In the five years up to 2021, BOI promoted financial inclusion by supporting the expansion of over 3 million enterprises, thereby creating over 7 million jobs. To expand its capital-base to meet the needs of its customers, and contribute to economic growth of the Nigeria, the bank made successful forays into the international market and raised about $3.8 billion in the last 4 years. This includes a $750mn syndicated medium-term loan in 2018 (fully paid); a €1 billion syndicated loan in March 2020; a $1 billion syndicated loan in December 2020; and in addition, a €750 million Senior Eurobond (the first by any African national DFI) in February 2022. Investor confidence in BOI is reflected in its balance sheet, which has more than doubled since 2017, growing significantly from N713 billion to about N1.7 trillion as at December 2021. BOI’s performance is reflected in its favorable credit ratings from global ratings agencies. Recently, Fitch Ratings upgraded the bank’s   National Long-Term Rating to ‘AAA (nga)’ from ‘AA+(nga);’ and affirmed the bank’s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘B’ with a Stable Outlook.
