Kasim Sumaina The Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), yesterday hinted its readiness to introduce a park and pay policy for motorists at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA), Abuja.The move, according to the agency, was part of the efforts to sanitise activities and bring sanity at the airport.The Manager/Regional General Manager North Central, Mr. Kabir Mohammed, disclosed this while speaking to the executive members of the Abuja Transportation and Aviation Correspondents Association (ATACA).Mohammed, who was deployed to head the Abuja Airport on March 10, 2022, further said the introduction of the park and pay at the airport would address the problems of touts, who go about harassing and extorting innocent drivers who bring in passengers at the airport.He also said as part of the ongoing reorganisation at the airport, the rowdy taxi drivers and the illegal businesses going on at the front of the departure hall at the airport would be addressed.Also, to curb the issue of the traffic jam at the toll gate of the airport, which have been affecting staff, airport users and passengers, the airport manager has commissioned a taskforce which constitutes of himself and head of departments to supervise at the toll gate on a daily basis with the sole aim of managing the inflow of traffic into airport.These efforts, according to him, had improved the situation to a great extent, making entry into the airport easier.Mohammed has also proposed the relocation of the Mosque to a more comfortable location for easier vehicular movement within the airport and the expansion of the car park.He, however, proposed the introduction of shuttle buses for staff, stakeholders and airport users, as well as staff welfare and recreation centre and introduction of staff weekly/monthly reporting which has made positive impact on staff discipline and performance.
