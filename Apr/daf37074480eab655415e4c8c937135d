 Bennett  Oghifo An upwardly mobile company, T-bobo has launched a new e-hailing system known as ZoomRyders, a transportation app that can be downloaded for rides in Lagos, for now but will be extended to other cities in future. The Chief Executive Officer, T-bobo, Olatunde Balogun, said their initiative would provide comfortable journeys, as it was designed to fill in the gaps inherent in present day e-hailing rides. The chief executive officer who was represented by Mr Olusanya Falusi said, “T-bobo is an e-hailing company and has come in to fill the gap and ensure the safety of commuters and also help the stakeholders who are the drivers that will be working for us. “One of the major reasons why we are coming in is to make sure that the safety of both the commuters and drivers are ensured. In a way, we ensure all our vehicles have cameras to instil confidence in our services.” “We want to ensure that whenever you are riding, you have the confidence to some extent that you are safe.” To join Tbobo, he said the firm ensures that it screens its drivers to ensure they have necessary documentation to drive and have no criminal record. “Once we get them on board, we are going to have inspection centres where they will ensure their cars are at good and motorable conditions. We will ensure we bridge the gap in service provision.” He said the firm has further plans to expand its services because it has capable hands within and outside the country in transportation. Speaking on the payment options, the Head Digital Payment, Fidelity Bank, Victor Moumonwe, said, “We power payment processing back end. We are going to replicate it for T-bobo such that if a rider gets on a ride, at the end of that journey, we are able to debit that customer successfully. “We are here to add value to what T-bobo is putting in place, we will ensure that the payment architecture is well captured.”
