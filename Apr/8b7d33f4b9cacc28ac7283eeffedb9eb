Receiving the award on behalf of the Don Lulu Foundation, Mrs. Peace Igbokwe, the mother of the Chairman of the Foundation, Mayor Lucky Igbokwe (Don Lulu) thanked the WIFW for the honour. She said although the Don Lulu Foundation doesn’t engage in its various humanitarian activities in order to attract recognition, the foundation was however grateful that people appreciate the little contributions the foundation is making to improve the living conditions of people especially women. Mrs. Igbokwe said the award is a call to do more.”The chairman and founder of the Don Lulu Foundation, Mayor Lucky Igbokwe (Don lulu) is a philanthropist, who cannot afford to see people suffer, he’s a man who is willing to sacrifice his comfort in order to render assistance to others, this award I’m sure will spur him to do more.
