IN PRAISE OF IBRAHIM IJAH Whatever is used as measurement of success would see the Executive Chairman of Tafa Local Government, Niger State, Hon. Ibrahim Mami Ijah, qualified as excellent. He is an achiever and a performer. Ibrahim Ijah, has performed beyond the expectations and imagination of the masses. He has managed the little resources effectively by providing the basic necessities of life to the people of the local government. He has also given hope to the hopeless by donating textbooks, exercise books, mathematical sets and other essential items to students of the council. Many roads in the Tafa Local Government were not motorable before he assumed office as Executive Chairman, but he put smiles on the faces of the road users by constructing roads, building schools equipped with computers in furtherance of the reality that the world is a global village. He also built health care centres for the masses, recreation centres and free uniforms for students in the area. He is sensitive to security issues, providing the people with a new lease of life after years of living in fear of moving from one place to another. He also provided jobs for the youth in the area; he purchased both GCE and NECO forms for the students, built modern markets at affordable prices for market women and men in the council. Ibrahim Ijah has proven a capacity to do everything humanly possible to help the needy and the destitute. He is widely admired for his vision and mission and indeed his capacity and ability to deliver. Anjorin Adeolu, Abuja
