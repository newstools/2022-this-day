 The wealthiest king to ever rule over the ancient kingdom of Israel, Solomon, cautioned rich people to be careful of subsequent generations. In his argument, he explained that such people have no idea whether their children will be good or terrible, so why not spend everything on everybody else? This is the same argument that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has begun to use in their censure of the son of billionaire business mogul, Chief Kessington Adebutu. Honourable Ladi Adebutu, the subject of APC’s incendiary comments, is to blame for everything, says the APC. According to the latter, Ladi’s unnecessarily braggadocious comments in a video that has begun to make the rounds on social media have no standing whatsoever. This is so considering that Ladi is not a child but a grown man who is expected to have outgrown such childish desires to boast about wealth that is not his but his father’s. From inquiry, the video that broke the camel’s back showed Ladi boasting about the fact that his father is immeasurably wealthy and all of that wealth belongs to him, and that the many philanthropic donations made by his generous father over the years will bear fruit in the form of the unconditional (forgive the irony) support of Ogun State people for him. And because Hon. Ladi is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), it is only expected that his APC rivals would be the first to point out the absence of deliberation and good sense in his comments about his father’s philanthropy and debt owed by the Ogun people on account of this largesse. As some of the officials of the APC have concluded about the issue, Hon. Ladi has nothing to offer the good people of Ogun. That was why he was rejected the first time and will continue to be rejected. Perhaps, he needs to grow up first before electing to represent them as their governor.
