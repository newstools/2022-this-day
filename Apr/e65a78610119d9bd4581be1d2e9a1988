 Former Kenyan President, Mwai Kibaki, who led the East African country for more than a decade, has died, his successor Uhuru Kenyatta announced yesterday. He was 90. “It is a sad day for us as a country. We have lost a great leader,” Kenyatta said in an address on state television. He ordered a period of national mourning until sunset on the day Kibaki is to be buried, with all flags to be flown at half-mast. Kibaki served as Kenya’s third president, from 2002 to 2013. “As a leading figure in Kenya’s post-independence history… Kibaki earned the biding respect and affection of the people of this nation,” Kenyatta said. “President Kibaki will forever be remembered as a gentleman in Kenya’s politics. A brilliant debater whose eloquence, wit and charm won the day time and time again.”
