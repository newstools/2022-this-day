However, we will need to interrogate further on what forms the basis of customers complaints in the banking sector and proffer solutions.” On his part, the Registrar/Chief Executive Officer, the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), ‘Seye Awojobi said the role of the institute in the last 22 years has been ensuring a good avenue at which banks customers are protected in collaboration with the CBN. According to him, “That, we have done effectively through subcommittees on ethnic and professionalism. The ICAN remains the secretariat of the bankers ‘committee subcommittee on ethnic and professionalism where customers with any complaint will actually report and we will agitate under an alternative dispute resolution mechanism to ensure the bank or any kind of transactions that have led to conflicts to be resolved. We encouraged the banks to attend to all customers’ complaints. “The subcommittee on ethnic and professionalism of CIBN and CBN encouraged banks to open customer complaints desks in their various institutions. It is when customers are not satisfied with the bank’s resolution, they can then escalate it to a subcommittee on ethnic and professionalism which has a secretariat in the institute to which I have been the secretary to the committee since 2012. “They can also escalate their complaints to the consumer protection department of CBN. Bank customers’ complaints are related to excess charges and the subcommittee has done so much that today courts in Nigeria refer cases to the subcommittee to resolve when a customer takes the bank to court. It does not cost anything.  EFCC also refers cases to the subcommittee since we look at cases on the basis principle of banking.”
