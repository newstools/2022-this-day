 Kuni Tyessi in Abuja For better medical delivery, the President of the Guild of Medical Directors (GMD), Dr Raymond Kuti, has said  the guild is being repositioned to remain a strong partner in the Nigerian healthcare sector. In a statement issued  yesterday in Abuja, Kuti said members of the GMD were the owners of private health facilities and deliver most of the care to Nigerians. According to him, the private health sector is wholly complementary to the public health sector and comparatively, better equipped, to deliver quality care. As part of efforts to ensure the repositioning, he said that the guild had concluded plans to hold a leadership and business summit in Abuja from May 12 to May 15. He said: “The summit aims to bring guild members in Nigeria together as we reposition the association for strategic engagements. The guild is desirous of stimulating a vibrant and dynamic private sector able to withstand the current economic downturn and still deliver superlative health care. “There will be didactic training on style, class, business planning, financial strategies, succession planning and politics. “The GMD needs to be at the table with government and its agencies when critical policy decisions are being made”, he added. Kuti said the summit was also to strengthen the footprints of the GMD and ensure viability of private health facilities.
