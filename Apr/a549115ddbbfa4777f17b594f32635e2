 Moses Simon grabbed his fourth goal of the season for FC Nantes to edge past Bordeaux 5-3 in Ligue 1 yesterday. The Super Eagles winger scored his team’s fourth goal in the 76th minute to make it 4-3 after visitors Bordeaux had raced to a 2-0 lead in the first half. Nantes are 10th on the log on 50 points from 34 games. Elsewhere, Gerson struck a late winner as Marseille beat Reims 1-0 away in Ligue 1 on Sunday, while Rennes shrugged off back-to-back losses to direct rivals for a Champions League spot by crushing Lorient to reclaim third place. Brazil international Gerson came off the bench to grab the only goal seven minutes from time and keep Jorge Sampaoli’s side six points clear of the chasing pack in second. They remain well placed to take France’s only other automatic qualifying berth for next season’s Champions League, but still have to play Lyon, Rennes and Strasbourg in three of their four remaining games.
