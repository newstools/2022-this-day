The agency explained that being a social security agency which is currently majorly funded from contributions of private sector employers to procure cover on behalf of their employees cannot be described as revenue. “The amount standing to the credit of the Employers Compensation Fund Account, does not fall under the Operating Surplus, intended by the Section 22 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
