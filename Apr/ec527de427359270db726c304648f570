 Money makes strange bedfellows of people, and so does politics. Thus, when both of these factors are involved, their characteristic bizarreness is amplified and even the mute would not be able to stop their mouths from murmuring something. This is the case for Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Senator Philip Aduda and the businessman and media influencer, Obi Cubana (real name Obi Iyiegbu). Both of these appear to be nurturing a friendship based on mutual admiration, although folks are bewildered regarding what they have in common. The old quote goes like this: “I went out to find a friend and could not find one anywhere. I went out to be a friend and friends were everywhere.” This is one way to describe the charm that has evolved out of Obi Cubana’s increasing popularity in recent days. He might have been a well-known character in the East, but it was only in the last 12 months that the Anambra man came to the national stage. Cubana is friendly to all, so he does not lack friends. However, it seems like more and more of those he would call his friends are individuals who might not have turned their heads to look at him a few years ago. Take Senator Aduda, for instance. In recent months, Aduda has been sighted time and again with Cubana, as the budding pair attend social functions together. A few days ago, Aduda was one of the political dignitaries that attended Cubana’s 47th birthday bash. Alongside other political bigshots like Rochas Okorocha, Aduda was treated with the utmost regard. And when Cubana tweeted about it, he called Aduda his “bro and friend.” The term ‘5 and 6’ is no longer in vogue but it describes the growing friendship between the Senator and the businessman. Whatever the case, it seems Cubana and Aduda have more in common than ordinary people know.
