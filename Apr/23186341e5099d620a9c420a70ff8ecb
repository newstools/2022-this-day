He stated that, “the development is also  borne of our founder commitment at providing all forms of support to the current administration in Kwara State owing to her pro-masses focus and even distribution of projects since assumption of office about three years ago. We shall be providing a support of N100m for a period of time through artisans, traders and farmers. Those categories of people shall be our primary focus. We will consider other layers of the society as well. “It no exaggeration that Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has performed beyond the ordinary bar of excellence, we therefore deemed it a duty to provide support for him here and there.” Gbadeyan added, “This Intervention will provide small grants for the petty traders, group loan for market women and support for farmers as an effort to create more wealth amongst our ever industrious people.”
