 Laleye Dipo in Minna The Sani Musa for Senate’s posters for 2023 election campaign surfaced in several parts of Minna, Niger State capital. Musa, who is presently the senator representing the Niger East Senatorial Zone of the state, had attempted to become the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) before the post was clinched by Senator Abdullahi Adamu via a consensus arrangement. The posters could be seen at strategic locations across Minna and in Paiko town, which is Musa’s home town, with the caption: “Is Sani Musa for Senate 2023.” It is not known if the posters had the support of the senator but THISDAY gathered that critical stakeholders in the senatorial zone have lent their support to his second term bid since he failed to get the national chairmanship of the party. “He has served us very well. That is why nobody has shown interest in contesting the seat with him,” said one of the critical stakeholders to THISDAY. Efforts by THISDAY to confirm the bid from Senator Musa was abortive as he could not be reached on his cell phones.
