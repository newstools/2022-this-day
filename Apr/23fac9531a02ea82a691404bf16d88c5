We are alive because we work and only the dead is incapable of working.”Aregbesola enjoined them to imbibe the culture of productivity, saying: “The end of work is productivity. It is productivity that leads to satisfactory provision of goods and services and wealth creation. It is therefore the path to national and individual prosperity.”He urged them to raise the bar of their trade in line with the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration’s drive to rev up the vehicle of governance and make all the people of Nigeria derive maximum benefit from the nation.The minister also congratulated all Muslims for the successful completion of the holy month of Ramadan.Aregbesola called on all Muslims to imbibe and practise the virtues of kindness, love, tolerance, peace, self-denial, sacrifice and good neighbourliness, as exemplified by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon Him).“The self-restrain, self-denial, sacrifice and deep spiritual consciousness that accompanied the fasting period should not end but be maintained and improved upon, in order to be a better person and true worshipper,” the minister advised all Muslims.He expressed confidence that the security challenges in some parts of the country will soon be a thing of the past, noting that the government is putting determined efforts and all necessary measures in place for Nigerians to enjoy unfettered peace all round.Aregbesola assured Nigerians that the administration of President Buhari is fully committed to the security of life and property of every citizen and foreigners alike.The minister commended all security agencies for the successes recorded in the fight against criminals across the country and the peace that has returned to the formerly embattled places. He however urged Nigerians to be part of the nation’s security architecture by being vigilant and reporting suspicious individuals and activities to law enforcement agencies nearest to them, noting that security is everybody’s responsibility.He wished all Muslims a happy Eidul-Fitr celebration and prayed that the peace, blessings and favours of Allah be with everyone.
