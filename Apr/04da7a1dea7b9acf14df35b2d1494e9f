Omolabake Fasogbon Carbonated soft drink (CSD) brand, The La Casera Company Plc has unveiled a new packaging for its Nirvana Table Water at an appreciation event it held for dealers in Lagos recently. The event had in attendance over 500 dealers from across Lagos State. The new Nirvana Table Water, which comes in 75cl, has a new label and a sleek bottle, as well as a small cap meant to eliminate spillage during consumption. Speaking, Managing Director of The La Casera Company Plc, Chinedum Okereke said the relaunch effort was a result of market research as well as dealers’ request for more innovative products. “The packaging now has a better shape, better dressing and of course lots of investment in terms of capacity. We are very confident that it will drive growth for the brand, especially as people continue to advocate for a healthy lifestyle”, Okereke said. Commenting, Group Marketing Director of Jotna Nigeria, Mr. Emmanuel Agu said, “The bottle cap has been designed in such a way that the content can hardly spill on you when you open it. You don’t need to go to the gym to open the cap as it is so easy to open and at the same time very well secured. “Again, the bottle design was done to fit perfectly with the symmetry of one’s hand. What we are celebrating with this relaunch is technology per excellence in the production and packaging of water business in Nigeria”. Agu thanked consumers for their continued patronage and loyalty. He also pledged continuous commitment to top quality. Also present at the occasion, the Executive Secretary of Lagos State Water Regulatory Commission, Mrs. Funke Adepoju commended the firm in making safe and affordable water available to the masses as in line with the state government’s agenda.
