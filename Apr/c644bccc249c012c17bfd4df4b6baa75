Reacting to the submission by the applicant lawyer, counsel for EFCC, Simon Ibekwute, and counsel for the third respondents (Chukwudozie), Patrick Ikwueto (SAN), admitted for extension of time for them to also reply the motions by the applicant. However, having listened to the submissions by the counsel in the matter, the presiding Judge, Justice Diepiri, adjourned till the aforementioned date to hear their motions.

Ibeto (applicant) had filed the application in suit number: PHC/268/FHR/2022, on fundamental human rights. He’s seeking the court to prevent the EFCC from investigating allegations of fraud bordering on obtaining by false pretense the sum of N4.8 billion forgery and criminal breach of trust brought against him by Dozzy Oil and Gas Limited. Ibeto also prayed the court to declare the harassment on him unlawful; and that the EFCC is not empowered to tackle contract matters; EFCC lacks power to handle land transactions; an injunction to restrain EFCC from arresting Ibeto, as well as to pay N500million damages for unconstitutional arrest of the applicant.
