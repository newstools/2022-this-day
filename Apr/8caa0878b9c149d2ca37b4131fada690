 Emma Okonji In line with its efforts to support Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education in Nigeria, Africa’s integrated payments and digital commerce company, Interswitch, has announced plans to donate Information Technology (IT) equipment to students in 10 tertiary institutions across Nigeria. The initiative, which is being implemented in collaboration with Cisco, will see Interswitch donate IT equipment including routers and switches to the Cisco Networking Academies in these institutions. Speaking about the donation, Group Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Interswitch Group, Cherry Eromosele, said Interswitch had always been committed to improving learning, especially in STEM courses. “We understand that the study of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics courses is not a walk in the park, however, going through the rigors of studying STEM subjects without basic tools such as a computer can be unnerving. This is why we are donating the IT equipment to the networking academies with the belief that more students will be equipped to hone their skills in STEM and consequently pursue careers in STEM,” Eromosele said. Commenting on the collaboration with Interswitch, Country Lead at Cisco, Nigeria, Sebastine Nzeabine, said: “Cisco Networking Academy transforms the lives of learners, educators and communities through the power of technology, education and career opportunities. Critical to this is creating connections through access to infrastructure, forging opportunities by investing in people to help create a skilled economy and inclusion of all citizens to give them efficient technology solutions to address their unique local needs.”
