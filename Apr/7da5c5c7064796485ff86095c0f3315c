HighLife The case with political succession in Nigeria has always been unilateral: one person takes over from another and war emerges between them. Sometimes, as in the case of Anambra State, it is not very clear whether the incumbent governor has schemed against the predecessor. Other times, as in the case of Akwa Ibom, it is very clear. Chief Godswill Obot Akpabio is a remarkable person. From the year 2000 until now, the Ukana man has always been in a position where he does not need to fear mediocrity or poverty. His political career, especially, has buoyed his aspirations and weight, leading to his becoming one of the most influential political figures in the country. But this might be a thing of the past Akpabio’s successor, Governor Udom Gabriel Emmanuel, is gradually taking over everything that Akpabio is known for in Akwa Ibom. Bit by bit, Akwa Ibom people are starting to see Emmanuel as the Superintendent of the State, a position that Akpabio occupied in the eyes and minds of the people until only recently. From recent reports on his doings, Akpabio, who is currently the Minister of Niger Delta, is gradually losing relevance in the state he once managed as its executive governor. Despite his robust political experience, his intermittent feud with Emmanuel has placed him in a bad position where he is gradually losing grip of any significant political influence in Akwa Ibom. If it was any other person, the growing loss of relevance in his state would not impact him too much. But for Akpabio who is so closely tied to the rise and fall of Akwa Ibom, this loss is like mandated suicide. And that is what Akpabio is reportedly gradually turning into in the minds of some of the people: the Judas that does the bidding of Caiaphas and delivers the kiss of betrayal.
