The five per cent initial interest rate was increased for a further 12 months by the Central Bank of Nigeria, and nine per cent subsequently. “Both loans commenced in October 2020, hence the initial five per cent interest rate was meant to end in February 2021, however, due to the extention granted, the five per cent will continue until February 2022, and the nine per cent interest charge will now commence from March 2022.” For the year under review, BUA cement reported Operating Expenses (OPEX) grew by 27.3 per cent to N19.33billion in 2021 from N15.19billion in 2020, due to sharp increases in admin expenses that grew by 29.1 per cent to N13.32billion in 2021  and selling and distribution expenses rose by 24 per cent to N6.01 billion in 2021 from N4.86billion in 2020.

Non-current bank borrowings are secured by fixed and floating assets of the Company. “They include N26 billion obtained from First Bank of Nigeria Plc for a period of 48 months with effect from July 2020 at a floating interest of 13.5per cent per annum. N2billion was obtained from Union Bank of Nigeria and Fidelity Bank each for a period of 120 months with effect from October 2020 at a floating interest of five per cent per annum till February 2022 and then nine per cent afterwards.” On debt security issued in 2021, BUA Cement reported N113.56billion in 2021 from N113.2billion in 2020. It added that: “The Company issued a local bond of N115 billion on 30 December 2020 with a coupon rate of 7.5% payable semi-annually (Series 1 of N200 billion bond issuance programme). The bond has a tenor of 7 years and is due on 30 December, 2027. There is a moratorium of 3 years on the principal repayment of the bond, whilst interest is payable on a semi-annual basis at their respective interest rates. BUA Cement Plc will have the right to exercise a call option to effect early redemption of the bonds, either in part or in whole, as from the expiration of 48 months from the issue date, in accordance with the provisions of the Series 1 Trust Deed. On initial recognition of the Series 1 bond, management assessed the impact of the call option on the contractual cash flows to the bondholders and determined that the call option does not materially affect the contratual cashflows of the debt host contract, hence the option is closely related to the host contract and is not bifurcated from the host contract. The Series1 bond has been classified as a debt measured at amortised cost using effective interest rate.” Analysts View According to analysts at Cordros research: “We like that BUA Cement optimised its price/volume mix to keep margins stable despite energy cost pressures caused by the local currency devaluation amidst high inflationary pressures. “We expect private sector demand for cement to moderate this year as activities in the real estate sector normalise to pre-pandemic levels. “In addition, we are concerned about the ability of the company to transfer the burden of elevated energy prices to consumers in a bid to preserve margins, given that cement producers have raised prices significantly over the past two years. “Nevertheless, we believe economies of scale associated with the new and energy-efficient Kalambiana line II (3MMT) will provide some support for margins. Our estimates are under review.”
