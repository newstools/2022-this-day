 The old saying goes as follows: one good turn deserves another. This maxim, brief though it be, captures the essence of the latest development regarding the prospects of Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, especially concerning his second term in government. The highest authority in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, the Governance Advisory Council (GAC) has given its approval regarding Sanwo-Olu’s second term. There is no doubting the administrative strength of Governor Sanwo-Olu. Barely three years into his administration, the man has revolutionised the city of Lagos. The fondly expressed motto that Lagos will continue to be fresh and flourishing has really come to life thanks to Sanwo-Olu’s many merits and commitment to the good of the land. Thus, it was not all that surprising when GAC unanimously declared that Sanwo-Olu is qualified to get a second term due to his good works. This may just be the first time that the GAC is coming to such a resolution without resorting to endless hours of argument. The apex body of the political ruling class understands that getting an administrator of Sanwo-Olu’s variety, who will slave away his time and energy for the betterment of the people, and also employ others to share the burden with him, is a rare fortune. Why not let it repeat itself? Why not let Lagos shine among its peers for another 4 years? The APC primaries are only a few weeks away, so this decision that has been published by the GAC is unparalleled in its influence. Essentially, except something indescribably untoward happens, the Lagos governorship seat is going back to Sanwo-Olu. Moreover, outside of a few people who dislike him for their reasons, Sanwo-Olu is a darling to the people of Lagos, great and small alike. So, if even the elite body has surrendered their stamp of approval, there is no obstruction worth mentioning that has any chance of holding him back.
