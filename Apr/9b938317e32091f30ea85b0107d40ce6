*World Cup draw holds today in DohaFemi Solaja with agency report Super Eagles made appreciable lift in the March rankings released by FIFA yesterday despite failing to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Nigeria climbed six steps up from the previous ranking and are now in the 30th position. Eagles are also number three in Africa, while Algeria that similarly failed to qualify for Qatar 2022 dropped out of Africa’s top five into number seven. At the global level, Brazil having spent 4,731 days which is the longest time at the top of the ranking by any team before they dropped down, are now back on top, five years after they were last there.  Their recent 4-0 defeat of Chile at home and another 4-0 away humiliation of Bolivia in the World Cup qualifying series enabled the South Americans to overtake Belgium in the number one position,  Belgium had been on top in the past three years. But their recent 2-2 draw with Ireland may have impacted in their current ranking. The March 2022 table is therefore a new chapter in rankings history, but more than that, it will be used to calculate the seeds for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Final Draw which will take place this afternoon in Doha.
