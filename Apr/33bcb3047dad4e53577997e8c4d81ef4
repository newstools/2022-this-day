HighLife The Northern region is not known for any complicated succession system. Nevertheless, what is a tradition meant for if not to be broken? At least, that is what it is starting to look like in Katsina State with the eyes of the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mustapha Muhammad Inuwa, set unflinchingly to the seat of Governor Aminu Bello Masari. But will the latter throw his weight behind his SSG of two terms? More and more people of substance and influence have begun to nod at the gubernatorial ambition of Katsina SSG, the indefatigable Inuwa. According to some of these, there is no better person to continue the legacy of Governor Masari than someone who stayed by his side for the entire eight years he was in power. While some of these comments have undoubtedly shifted the mechanisms of Katsina politics in Inuwa’s favour, they are not enough to win him the seat come 2023. However, one person that may be able to smoothen the path for Inuwa is the very governor he is set to succeed, Masari. Despite how politics is run in Nigeria, the north can be expected to uphold its interests first. This is the reason behind its unity anytime the presidential contest comes along. But within the northern house, tensions exist over who will take over from whom. But no such tensions are known to exist between Inuwa and his boss, Masari. This fact places Inuwa miles ahead of other prospective aspirants for the Katsina top chair, including Ahmed Musa Dangiwa, Dikko Radda, Farouk Lawal Jobe, Sadiq Yar’adua, Mannir Yakubu Umar Abdulahi Tata, and Senator Abu Ibrahim. But nothing is set in stone as of now. Nevertheless, things are looking good for Inuwa with Masari potentially holding him by the hand to introduce him to the people. Then again, that is what happened in Anambra, and look how that turned out for the outgoing governor.
