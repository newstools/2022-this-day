 Bennett  Oghifo The National Automotive Design & Development Council (NADDC) is working on an Electric Vehicle Policy, under which is a set of fiscal incentives for both producers and buyers/users of EVs in Nigeria. The Director General of the Council stated this at the Nigerian Energy Summit II, organised by Germany, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Power, and the European Union in Lagos, recently. Aliyu reiterated the Council’s commitment towards the local production of environmentally-friendly Electric Vehicles (EVs) for use by every Nigerian. The agency, he said, plans to enable an increase in the capacity of Electric Vehicle production in the country. This, he said, would support the provision of more EVs that are applicable to the Nigerian condition, and would allow the nation to meet its targets for the Paris Accord and the 2060 net zero emission commitment, on reducing the emission of harmful gas from vehicles. He also presented their strides in developing 100 per cent solar-powered EV charging stations, sited at three universities across the country. These are Uthman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto, University of Lagos and University of Nigeria, Nsukka, in a strategic move that is aimed at bringing advanced automotive related technology to the doorsteps of students as an effective technology transfer initiative. Aliyu’s presentation showcased a video of the first Nigerian Assembled Electric Vehicle, the Hyundai Kona EV, and also that of the Jet Mover Electric Delivery Van from Indegenous Nigerian automotive company, Jet Systems Motors. At the end of the summit, participants had the opportunity to drive the Hyundai Kona EV to get a feel of the vehicle’s technology.
