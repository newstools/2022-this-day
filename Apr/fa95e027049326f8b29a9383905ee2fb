 HighLife If there is one person in the corporate sector that Nigerian youths should aspire to be like, it should be Tony Elumelu. Elumelu has been the torch-bearer of torch-bearers in the business and economic development world. With his singular efforts, Africa has witnessed a complete revitalisation of its youthful strength. Consequently, if Elumelu does not gain global renown, it would be an injustice Knowing this, TIME Magazine recently honoured Elumelu with a TIME100 Impact Award. The event which was held in Dubai, saw Elumelu receive his award to the thunderous applause of the audience. If that event had been held where progressive African youths can all attend, there would be no chance for Elumelu to express his thanks since the applause would go on and on. But Elumelu was allowed to say his piece in Dubai during the prestigious event. And he took the time out to hail “hardworking young men and women in Africa, who aspire to help their families and their communities.” That is a great man for you, using every opportunity to empower other people. What other model of corporate growth and development does a young African need when Elumelu is around to cheer them on? For those that only hear about happenings after decades have passed, there is no other living individual of Nigerian origin who has empowered more African youths than Elumelu. In the last five years, Elumelu has given out $5,000 each to about 15,000 African entrepreneurs through his Tony Elumelu Foundation. And many of those beneficiaries have not betrayed his trust. Instead, innovation after innovation has emerged on the African continent. If it is only for what he does for the African continent, Elumelu deserves another award after TIME Magazine’s. And yet a hundred more.
