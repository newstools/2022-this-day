 Pharmaceutical firm, Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals Plc has announced that it would be expanding its manufacturing capacity by 300 percent to improve customers’ experience. The Managing Director/CEO of organisation, Matthew Azoji noted that the expansion move followed the organisation’s ongoing facility upgrade of its factory in Oregun, Lagos. Azoji expressed that the upgrade would increase Neimeth’s turnover and profits.

Azoji said, “Neimeth’s fortunes have improved since 2018, when it turned a profit after nearly a decade of losses. From a loss of N404.9 million in 2017, the company earned N166.4 million in 2018, N304.4 million in 2019, N297.3 million in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, and N365.2 million in 2021.” Chairman of Neimeth’s Board of Directors, Dr. Ambrosie B.C. Orjiako stated that the board was working with management to ensure that the company’s growth trajectory was maintained, adding that Neimeth has  transitioned from a period of constant losses to one of consistent growth in both turnover and profitability.
