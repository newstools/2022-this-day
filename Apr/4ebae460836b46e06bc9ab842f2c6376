Tosin Clegg Nollywood has ushered in a new era, with movies spreading awareness about mental health, while delivering the romance and lighthearted comedy that we all enjoy. At the forefront of this movement is the upcoming movie, “I am Nazzy.” It is a film about life, dreams, and hope. In it, a fast rising music- artiste’s picture-perfect life suddenly goes haywire when the lady accidentally switches places with a doppelganger.

The movie is brought to you by Film City Studios and Blue Pictures Entertainment. It is the debut movie production for leading actress, Chinonso Arubayi and directed by director extraordinaire Kayode Peters. The Movie premiered at EbonyLife Cinemas with an elaborate red carpet event on Sunday 27th March 2022.
