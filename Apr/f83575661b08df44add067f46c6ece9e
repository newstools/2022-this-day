 The  sit-at-home order in the Eastern States caused a confusion yesterday as armed policemen stormed the State Headquarters of Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, shooting sporadically. According to some residents of Okigwe Road and Works Layout, they had scampered into the safety of their rooms due to the serious shooting. “ We have all scampered into the safety of our rooms. From where I am hiding with members of my family, I can’t hazard a guess on the people shooting,” a resident said. “I’m not sure if the unknown gunmen are at it again, but I must, however, say that the shooting appears endless. I will keep you posted if the situation gets clearer,” he added. Also a  businessman, who operates his outfit in the area said: “The shooting spree is between the police and NSCDC personnel. I understand that a police officer was arrested for a yet to be ascertained infraction and detained by NSCDC officers. I also learnt that he alerted his colleagues and they stormed NSCDC. “It is not clear if they succeeded in getting their man out from detention or not. It is also not clear if anybody died in the process, but the massive shooting was uncalled for. “The invading police officers ought to have chosen a more civilized approach in resolving whatever was the issue, instead of taking laws into their hands. I expect the State Commissioner of Police to fish out the fellows that attacked the NSCDC Headquarters and punish them appropriately.”
