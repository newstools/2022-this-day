Adedayo Akinwale A former Governor of Jigawa state, Sule Lamido has said that the position of the Northern Elders was not only injurious to the North but equally injurious to the Northern aspirants ahead of the presidential primary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Recall that Prof. Ango Abdulahi had claimed in a statement that former Senate President Bukola Saraki and Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed had emerged  consensus candidates of the PDP from the North. But reacting through a statement he personally signed on Saturday,  Lamido insisted that the position of the Northern Elders was not the position of the party. His words: “The attention of key stakeholders of the PDP in the Northern State is drawn to reports in the Media that some Northern Elders have shortlisted two of our prominent and deserving aspirants as consensus PDP Presidential Candidates“Having widely consulted Party Leaders across the 19 Northern States and FCT, it is hereby stated to our teeming party members and the general public that what is reported in the media is only the personal opinion of those who issued the statement and not the position of the PDP members in the North” The PDP chieftain noted that discussions were ongoing with all the aspirants in the party with a view to having a National Consensus if possible or at least working towards having a smooth acrimony-free National Convention. “The position of the Northern Elders is not only injurious to the North but equally injurious to the Northern aspirants,” Lamido added
