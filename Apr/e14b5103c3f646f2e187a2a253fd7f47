 Akwa United turn of good form in the second half of the season continued with another home win against Lobi Stars and Coach Deji Ayeni insists his club’s current form was expected but still work in progress. Speaking after his side’s lone goal triumph against Lobi Stars in a MatchDay 25 fixture played at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium on Sunday, Ayeni confessed that he was overwhelmed by the outcome of his first six games. He praised his players for maintaining a high degree of consistency and being focused. “We are happy with the result, but I still maintain that the team is still a work in progress. We are not there yet. In the situation we have found ourselves, the fans desire more, and we must do our best to meet their aspirations. I think we can assess the team better after matchday 30”, he said. Ayeni, who joined the Promise Keepers in mid-season, has not suffered a defeat since the MatchDay 20 draw at home to Rivers United, with the 6-1 bashing of Nasarawa United top of the list of results he has amassed for the Uyo side since taking over from Kennedy Boboye. Bello Babatunde’s stunning effort from the edge of the area in 37 minutes was all Akwa United needed to see off Lobi Stars of Makurdi. Despite dominating possession for most of the second half, Lobi Stars could not secure the equalizer that could have put them level on points with Dakkada FC and Abia Warriors. The result propelled Akwa United to 5th on the log, pending the outcome of Sunshine Stars’ date away to Kano Pillars in Abuja. Lobi are two points above the relegation zone but could end the MatchDay in the drop zone if Kano Pillars and Heartland FC win their respective fixtures today.
