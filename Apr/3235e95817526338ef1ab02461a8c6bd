 Laleye Dipo in Minna A priest in a Minna Catholic Church, Dr Leo Raphael Ozigi has finally regained his freedom after spending three weeks in the captivity of bandits and terrorists in Niger State. Ozigi, according to THISDAY checks, was released Friday night. Multiple sources told THISDAY that the clergyman was released after the payment of N10m by the Catholic church in Minna. THISDAY learnt that a high-powered delegation was in Birnin Gwari forest in Kaduna State to pay the ransom to the bandits Friday. The team, according to the sources, left Minna the Niger State capital at about 11 a.m Friday with the ransom packed in a big envelope which was delivered to the bandits at an appointed spot. After delivering the envelope containing the ransom, THISDAY checks revealed that the contact person asked the team to go towards Zaria to pick the priest. It was gathered that Ozigi trekked several kilometres before he could team up with members of the church. “He is very sick. He could hardly walk when released on Friday,” one of those that went to facilitate the release of the priest confided in THISDAY. Asked about the whereabouts of the clergyman, one of the team members said: “He is somewhere receiving treatment. He has to go for physiotherapy because he couldn’t walk”. The source confirmed that ransom was paid, though did not disclose how much was paid as ransom. He said: “Only Baba (Bishop) knows the amount” Efforts to get the Catholic ArchBishop of Minna Diocese Martins Uzougwu was abortive as his cell phone was switched off. Ozigi was kidnapped by terrorists along the Minna –Sarkinpawa road when he was returning from a church programme about three Sundays ago. He was said to have been kept in solitary confinement by his abductors who fed him differently from other victims.
