 Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has sealed the Federal Ministry of Works and the Federal Character Commission over N10 billion debts owed the  Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB). The sealing up was carried out early Tuesday morning. The Director of AEPB, Osilama Briamah said the board was providing waste management and other environmental services to the defaulting MDAs while they refused to pay. He explained that the board had huge amount laying without response from the defaulters. “We tried to negotiate to have a better way to achieve results but there was no positive response, we have given them payment plan but many of them refused to take this opportunity serious, the board then resorted to legal means to recover the debts and secured court orders to seal the premises” he said. According to him, the exercise which has just begun will cover all public and private offices owing the board. A senior magistrate court sitting in Wuse II, Abuja had served the defendants with summons to appear before the court on March 30, 2022 but they failed to honour the court. The break down of the debts showed that Federal ministry of Education owed N25,838,275, Federal Ministry of Defence –N17,220,775.00 and Federal Character Commission—N10,128,906.25.

The Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring Inspection and Enforcement to the minister of FCT, Ikahro Attah who led the enforcement said the operation followed the initiative put together by the minister of FCT and the permanent secretary to recover the extreme debts owed the board. Attah stated that the FCT Administration was worried about the high amount being owed FCTA. “FCT Administration needs enough fund to build infrastructure and keep the city running. The administration has decided to go after the Ministries, parastatals, agencies and private individuals. “We cannot wait to see government money tie down, is wrong for people not to pay for services rendered” he said.
