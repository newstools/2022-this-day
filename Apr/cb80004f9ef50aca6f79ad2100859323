 *Balogun, Aribo crash with Rangers as Celtic extend Scottish League lead Femi Solaja with agency report Even in the absence of their top striker, Victor Osimhen, Napoli gave their title aspiration a big push yesterday after they defeated Atalanta 3-1 away in the Italian Serie A. The Nigerian international was not  in Napoli’s matchday lineup after featuring in the 2022 World Cup playoffs with Ghana’s Black Stars. Nigeria lost the Qatar 2022 World Cup ticket on the away goal rule to the Ghanaians. Yesterday’s victory has now pushed Napoli go level on same 66 points as AC Milan on the Serie A log. It was also Napoli’s third straight win and their fourth in their last five matches. Lorenzo Insigne opened the scoring on 14 minutes from the penalty spot before Matteo Politano made it 2-0 on 37 minutes. Atalanta pulled a goal back on 58 minutes through Marten de Roon before Eljif Elmas netted Napoli’s third in the 81st minute. Milan however will go three points clear if they beat Bologna at the San Siro this evening. Elsewhere, the duo of Leon Balogun and Joe Aribo were on the losing side at home as Rangers lost 1-2 to eternal rivals, Celtic at the Ibrox Stadium yesterday afternoon. The duo just like last Tuesday in Abuja when Nigeria drew 1-1 with Ghana and lost out on away goal rule, both Balogun and Aribo played all through 90 minutes and gave Celtic the chance to move closer to reclaiming the Scottish Premier title which Rangers won in grand style last season without losing any match. In the performance rating after the match, Balogun was given 4/10 score because of his weak header that resulted in Carter- Vickers’ goal. It was adjudged sloppy with weak passes all through the match. His compatriot, Aribo got average pass mark.
