 Ebere  Nwoji Insurance operators have sought for close ties with members of the Organised Private Sector (OPS) adding that this would expose OPS members to gains and values of insurance to their business and at the same time open business opportunities to the insurers. The insurers stated this during a visit of a delegation of Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) to the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI). At the meeting, LCCI president, Dr Michael Olawale Cole, expressed the chamber’s readiness to forge better collaboration with the Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) in order to open up the entire body of the organised private sector to the values of insurance.. Olawale-Cole, while receiving the NCRIB delegation led by the president Mr Rotimi Edu, opined that the Chamber, one of the foremost and formidable financial advocacy platforms would be offered to insurance brokers to propagate knowledge about the values of insurance to business and commerce. Also speaking, NCRIB President, Mr. Rotimi Edu, stated that the visit of the Council to LCCI was part of the Council’s strategic engagement with professional bodies in a bid to broaden the frontiers of its relevance among the organised private sector in Nigeria. He urged the Chamber to use its platform to educate its members on the importance of all the compulsory insurances, adding  that insurance industry was not yet where it should be in terms of patronage and public acceptance “We will appreciate that your Chamber gets the NCRIB involved in some of your programs both at international and national levels by giving room for the Council to tell the story. If the Chamber preaches this to all its members, it will ensure comfortability in times of claim. Edu said exposing the council to alliance with government, independent bodies is in fulfillment of his promise to the council in this regard during his investiture and acceptance speech.
