HighLife  Money is a very, very, very useful instrument. How many individual and corporate dreams have failed to come to fruition because of the lack of money? And so the initiated know that humanity may not go so far as to worship money, but the regard we have for the very concept is high up there with the regard we have for the nourishing sun. Nobody knows this fact better than the gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State, Bisi Kolawole. Those close to the thick of things in Kolawole’s camp have started to whisper stories of the man’s inability to sustain the entirety of his campaign portfolio due to a shortage of funds. The reports claim that Kolawole’s number one supporter, who doubles as his godfather, Ayo Fayose, may not be willing to empty his treasuries to assist Kolawole in this endeavour. This might even be a test for the PDP candidate to see whether or not he can fend for himself. But the pressure cannot be healthy for any sane person. After all, Fayose’s chief political rival in Ekiti, the incumbent Governor Kayode Fayemi, is not using the same method to polish his preferred candidate, Biodun Oyebanji. He (Fayemi) has given Oyebanji the master key to his network and net worth. Thus, Kolawole has that to consider irrespective of his personal feelings at this point. Moreover, as analysts have theorised, this might be his last chance to get into the inner rooms of Ekiti’s administrative house. Failure to get in this time might keep him forever on the political outskirts. These things, however, are never as concrete as they appear. Consider, for example, the fact that Kolawole seemingly had an easy time getting the PDP ticket. Fayose had much to do with his victory over former Governor Olusegun Oni. Nevertheless, a godfather can only do so much. In comparison, money can do so much more—or so we believe. Whatever the case, Kolawole is allegedly in dire need of campaign funds.
