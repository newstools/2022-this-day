 Felix Oboagwina Two souls stood in the presence of their Maker in the before-life, to hear what destinies they should follow on earth. “Each of you will live illustrious lives in one and the same land,” they were told. “Each of you will marry your wives and bear a suitable cluster of children. “Each of you will bury children birthed from your own loins. “Each of you will suffer frustration and find an uphill task in the quest to lead the land of your birth. “Each of you, in the quest to lead the Land of your birth, will lose your liberty and be cast into the dungeon. “One of you shall be endowed with immense wisdom in a head destined never to wear the prized crown. “The other one will snatch, lose but finally wear the coveted crown of the land. “Now, each must choose. “Will you want to be the soul who never wore the crown, but will forever remain idolized as, ‘The Best Leader the country never had?’ “Will you want to be the soul who will wear the crown and be derided as, ‘The Worst Leader the country wished it never had?'” The wise soul has since served his uncrowned time and has gone to the after-life; his people forever venerate him like a god. The other soul elected to wear the crown; and in his dishonour, his tormented people disrespect his name. Oboagqina, an author and journalist sent this piece from Lagos.
