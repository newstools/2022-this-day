 Omolabake Fasogbon Catering outfit, Dandies has reaffirmed its commitment to quality and improved service at the occasion of its 10th anniversary. The firm also hinted of plans to expand its scope of operations beyond offering catering services for corporate, weddings and social events. Chief Executive Officer of the firm, Modupe Odubiro expressed appreciation to all stakeholders who have been part on the organisation’s story in ten years. She assured that the organisation would not compromise on quality, rather raise the bar on quality for which it was known for. She said, “Since we began in 2012, we have adopted the use of up-to-date techniques and skilled personnel in keeping to our vision of being the most desirable catering company with one-time delivery and continuous ground-breaking professional development. “We have also try to remain relevant in the sector with modern operations that kept us on top-of-mind recall by our range of clients across the banking, telecommunication, power, construction, public relations and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sectors. “Over the years, we have expanded our business to cover areas as event management, poultry farm, cooking and baking academy for kids/teens as well as raw packaged food.” She attributed the success of the business to customers’ loyalty, professionalism, ingenuity and its modus operandi. She revealed that the organisation would soon launch an ultra-modern restaurant and lounge in Ikeja, Lagos, to further strengthen its presence in Nigeria.
