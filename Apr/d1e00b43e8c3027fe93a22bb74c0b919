 Four games were decided on Monday in continuation of Matchday 25 of the Nigeria Professional Football League, (NPFL) with top teams winning at home to continue their push for the title. While Rivers had it rosy to take out Niger Tornadoes in Port Harcourt, Plateau United laboured to claim the match points against a continental hopeful, Remo Stars. NPFL top scorer, Ishaq Kayode put host Rivers United in front a minute after the hour mark as he finished off a through pass from Morice Chukwu with a chip over Lucky Jimoh. Rivers doubled their lead two minutes after as Nwagua Nyima tapped in a low cross from Chijioke Akuneto following a spill by Tornadoes’ keeper in the box. With ten minutes to end the game, substitute Konan Ruffin Ngouan made quick impact to put the icing on the cake for the leaders as he stabbed home Rivers’ third after he was released by Nelson Esor in Tornadoes’ box. The 3-0 victory meant Rivers United retained their top position on the log with 55 points after 25 league games. The Tin City Boys on the other hand kept the chase on leaders Rivers United close following a hard earned 1-0 win over Remo Stars in Jos, thanks to second half header from Ibrahim Buhari. The hosts could have taken the lead within the opening five minutes but Jesse Akila’s goal was chalked off for offside after the referee had spotted an infringement in the build up to the goal. Plateau are still within distance to Rivers with 51 points from 25 games. RESULTS Rivers Utd 3-0 Tornadoes Plateau 1-0 Remo Stars Shooting 2-0 Enyimba Wikki  0-0 Heartland
