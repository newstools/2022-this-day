 Chuks Okocha in Abuja The President of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), Professor Benjamin Okaba, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to create room for the restructuring of the country to save it from collapse amidst the worsening insecurity in the land.The INC President urged the federal government to give the necessary attention to the growing glamour from various quarters to restructure the country which has become a theatre of the daily murder of innocent Nigerians and sacking of villages by gun wielding terrorists.The INC President spoke at the occasion of the inaugural edition of the Boyloaf Annual Lecture and official launch of the “Boyloaf Foundation and 50th birthday celebration of Ebikabowei Victor-Ben( Boyloaf)  in Yenagoa.He stressed that the only solution to wrest the country from imminent collapse from the raging war from the terrorists is immediate restructuring.He said: “The Government must as a matter of urgency halt the wanton killing and destruction of properties and save the citizens from agony and misery. Politicians must also have a rethink as they jostle to occupy elective offices in the forthcoming 2023 general elections.“If half of the energy they put into electioneering is dedicated to solving the challenge of insecurity and rejigging the economy, there would be visible progress made in this regard. Citizens must also choose wisely and exercise their franchise with a sense of responsibility by voting only those who mean well for them.“At this juncture distinguished ladies and gentlemen, it is pertinent to reiterate that restructuring of this country is the panacea to rescuing the nation from imminent collapse. The government should listen to the clamour from various quarters for restructuring.“Nigeria is hemorrhaging under institutional dysfunctionality.”Okaba appealed to President  Buhari, as the Commander-In- Chief of the Armed Forces, to end the wanton killings and destruction of lives and property across the country.Okaba said the worsening insecurity in the country and lack of serious responses from the federal government  to confront the challenges had cause lots of avoidable deaths and destruction of public infrastructure and communities by bandits and terrorists across the country.He opined that the level of insecurity today requires urgent attention because the problem has gone out of hand.He condemned the heinous criminality and evil attacks on daily basis describing it as unbearable.“A frightening proportion and the gory tales of violence, killing, abductions and armed-ransacking of villages by dare-devil gunmen recorded every day in several parts of the nation is regrettable.“On a daily basis, Nigerians are hit by reports of killing, kidnapping and violent attacks by bandits and insurgents who invade communities and slaughter hapless people without any form of resistance by security agencies. The madness is taking a more frightening dimension as these hoodlums have taken over our roads, airports, waterways and railways, making life unbearable for the average Nigerian; and movement difficult in most parts of the nation.“The government must, as a matter of urgency, halt the wanton killing and destruction of property and save citizens from agony and misery.” He stated.Speaking further on the reprehensible environmental degradation in the Niger-Delta, oil spillage and air pollution, Okaba pointed out that the marine environment and the livelihood of the people had been destroyed.According to him, “Sustainable peace and development in the region could only be anchored on justice, equity and fairness.”He congratulated Victor-Ben on his 50th birthday celebration, adding that the formal launch of the foundation is commendable.He praised the celebrant for his active role he played in the Niger Delta struggle and self-determination, which he stated that resulted in the proclamation of Presidential Amnesty for the agitators.The Interim Administrator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), Col. Milland Dikio (rtd), in his keynote speech, entitled: “Peace, A Priceless Asset For Niger Delta Growth And Development,” affirmed that with peace, the Niger Delta would be best place to live and do business in the country.He said: “The marine environment and oil and gas resources were the greatest assets of the region, stressing the need for the people to embrace peace and allow development to take place unhindered.“We do not discount the past, the past for which Victor-Ben Ebikabowei and his colleagues represented. As glorious as the past is, the future is better and that future lays open before us to mound and shape.“We in the PAP have chosen to advance a vision which is that the Niger Delta will be the best place to live and do business in Nigeria. We need peace and development but we also have to network, collaborate and build bridges of alliance,” Dikio said.The Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Kombowei Benson, who represented Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, described Victor-Ben as a dogged fighter and a firm believer in his convictions.He congratulated him on his 50th birthday celebration and the official launch of his foundation to promote the welfare and wellbeing of the Niger Delta boy-child.
