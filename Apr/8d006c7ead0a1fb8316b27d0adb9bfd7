 Seriki Adinoyi Youth and women wings of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), a Coalition of Ethnic Nationalities, and some communities in Plateau state, yesterday staged a protest to the state Governor’s office in Jos over the incessant attacks and killings in some communities, calling on Governor Simon Lalong to intervene. There have been several attacks in recent weeks on some communities in the state, leading to death of several persons. Led by the National President of the Irigwe Youth Movement (IYM), Mr. Ezekiel Bini, the protesters urged Lalong to show commitment to securing the lives and properties of the people. Bini said they were out to tell the government and the world that lives were being wasted daily by gunmen, and to ask government to put immediate stop to the carnage. Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prof.  Danladi Atu, while addressing protesters said the state government was working hard on resolving the problem, especially in Irigwe land where attacks have been frequent, and to secure a lasting peace in the communities. He said Lalong feels the pains of the protesters, and commiserates with them and the families of those affected, adding that the governor had ordered reinforcement of security personnel to dominate the area, while thorough investigations are ongoing to unravel the cause of the attacks. Atu said, “Governor Lalong has also directed the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to step in to ascertain the extent of damage and casualties as well as provide immediate relief materials to cushion the effect of this condemnable act.”
