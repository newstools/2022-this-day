LIJF was last held live in 2019 and virtually in 2021. In a statement, LIJF founder and festival director Ayoola Sadare said “We are glad that we can once again resume live performances and the staging of Nigeria’s premier Jazz festival – The Lagos International Jazz Festival amidst all the challenges we faced. Our goal of establishing Lagos, Nigeria as a vibrant global Jazz tourism destination alongside cities like Cape Town, Montreal, Montreux, New Orleans, London and Tokyo among others in Africa and the world is still on course.” LIJF is designed to offer visitors and residents in Lagos world-class entertainment, attracting Jazz and contemporary music lovers to the city and by extension Nigeria. The festival has adopted and incorporated both the April Jazz Appreciation Month (JAM) and International Jazz Day into its program. International Jazz Day On April 30 is the culmination of Jazz Appreciation Month.
