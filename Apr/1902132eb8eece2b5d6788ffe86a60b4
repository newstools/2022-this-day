 Mary Nnah Eko Pool Festival has rebranded to become BlacPool Festival to add more value and expand its tentacles towards a greater purpose. BlacPool Festival is set to stage the fourth edition of the largest networking pool party in Africa. This forthcoming edition will also empower black women on the continent. Interacting with others to exchange information and improve professional or social contacts is vital in human existence for growth and development. BlacPool Festival will serve as a link to make this growth and expansion possible through its soon-to-be-unveiled activities slated for the event. “BlacPool Festival has been designed to become an impact project, progressively tackling empowering Black Women all across Africa,” BlacPool Festival organisers stated. “BlacPool Festival is an initiative focused on celebrating the largest and most luxurious pool party in Africa and also to give award recognition to distinguished individuals who have done exceptionally well for themselves,” the organisers added in a statement. Being the first of its kind on the continent, the BlacPool Festival hopes to empower the next generation of African women leaders with the skills set to build sustainable wealth calibrated for the new age “by combining our financial support to empower them to reach certain achievements.”
