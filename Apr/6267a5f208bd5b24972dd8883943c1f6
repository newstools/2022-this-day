Commenting, analyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye said: “banks are going to face challenges in interest income generated from loans to customers. The licensing of PSP to MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa going to pose a threat but banks with effective management understand the banks have been coping with the Fintech companies and trying to improve lending to customers through App USSD, among other devices.” On his part, the Vice President, Highcap Securities Limited, Mr. David Adnori expressed that bank customers’ have to decide where to borrow from with alternatives provided by Fintech and PSP operators. He maintained that banks are always prudent in managing interest income generated from loans and customers and are expected to thrive amid challenges posed by Fintech companies, among others. However, analyst at Vetiva Research believed that tough times still lie ahead for the banks, with interest rates poised to recover slowly, while inflationary pressures remain. The analysts added that competition from the new Payment Service Bank (PSB) licences issued to MTN Nigeria and Airtel pose a threat to some lines of the banks’ businesses. “Next year, we expect interest rates to remain in a steady upward trajectory, as government borrowing continues to rise to fund an ever-expanding deficit. However, we do expect inflation to continue to outpace this rise, meaning negative real returns for investors in the market, ”said banking analyst at Vetiva, Joshua Odebisi.
