 Adedayo Akinwale in AbujaAhead of the 2023 elections, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has declared free nomination forms for female aspirants who intend to contest. The National Women Leader of the party, Ms. Betty Edu disclosed this yesterday, during a media briefing held at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja.She said the leadership of the party took the decision to encourage all female aspirants and mainstream them in politics. Edu said President Muhammadu Buhari and the First lady, Aisha Buhari have done enough to mainstream women. She added: “And to further buttress that point, we are the largest party in Africa and we want to make a strong statement that we stand by inclusion, mainstreaming for women. The party has gone ahead to approve that women will be running with a free nomination form “They have thrown the ball into our court. Before now we have women saying we cannot afford nomination forms. We have been given the greatest chance to emerge the winner of an election because we will be running on a ticket of the ruling party. Not just a ruling party, a party that has performed, a party that has provided welfare for Nigeria, a party that is ready to mainstream women. “Edu, therefore, called on women to stand up and contest, while urging them to get involved in a series of processes that would lead up to the 2023 elections. She emphasised that women must be actively involved in the political process and must go from door-to-door to sensitise women to go out and participate in the ongoing registration of Independent National Electoral (INEC).
