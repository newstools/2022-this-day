 Time, for all the importance that we attach to it, is not everything. Who said that a young, beautiful and talented lady has to be married by age 23 or 25? Who said that a man that is around the same age should not consider anything other than building a business and a massive house with parking spaces and fine cars? When did women become furniture and men become carpenters? Well, it is a joy and a delight that legendary Nollywood actress, Rita Dominic, has broken these stereotypes with the darling of her soul, Fidelis Anosike. It was a very happy day on April 19, 2022, in Imo State when Dominic tied the knot with her heartthrob, Anosike. The wedding ceremony had all categories of notable personalities across the country, especially Nollywood personalities and business people shutting down Owerri. They were there to see beauty among beauties and talent among talents finally get married after being subject to many speculations and the recurrent “God when!” that is declared on her behalf. For those who are just following the story, there are several reasons Dominic’s and Anosike’s wedding drew the attention of all and sundry. For one, Dominic has been a notable presence in the Nollywood scene since donkey years. Her beauty and talent always marked her for greatness, and indeed she has achieved it to a great degree. The only problem, according to people who refused to mind their business, was the fact that she remained unmarried. The reason for Dominic’s abstinence remains a secret known to her and those she deems qualified to know. What is known everywhere is that she found love in the arms of Daily Times boss, Anosike. And they have been together for quite some time, choosing only to make their relationship public sometime in 2020. Since then, the media has been on its toe about when the bells would ring. And now, they have. So everybody can rest as they send off the Anosikes to their happily-ever-after.
