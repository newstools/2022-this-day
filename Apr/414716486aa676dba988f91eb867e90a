  Time heals all wounds. This is what time has taught humanity and one of the reasons we are always grateful for the progression of the days, weeks, months, and years. Just imagine that we were all stuck in the same loop of time, unable to leave, subject to the same things again and again. And so it is with a sigh of relief that the public welcomes back Idaere Ogan, fondly called Ambassador, back into its arms. Death comes to teach us lessons about the frailty of life. When death came to the household of the Ogans, it taught this lesson in very vivid colours and took the life of Ogan’s son, Toku, as evidence of its lesson and payment. As most people know, it was a devastating blow, especially considering the situation reported to have surrounded the death of the 25-year-old. From the rumours that floated in the streets around the time of the passing of Toku, it was gathered that he had led a brilliant life. However, his death was both suspicious and sad, following which his father, Ambassador, lost his sight of all good things in the world. Rather than mingle with everybody else until the memory of that pain disappears, Ogan decided to embrace the life of a recluse, and so it has been for a while now. However, recent reports claim that Ogan is out of the shadows and has courageously stepped into the light. Time, it seems, has helped him better bear the loss of his dear son, and the sudden disappearance of the many expectations he had of the late Toku. After all, as reports claimed, Toku was being groomed to be like his father and eventually take over from him. Alas, death came. Nevertheless, these things should be forgotten. What matters now is that Ogan is back. A joy that only he can bring has come.
