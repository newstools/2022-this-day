 To every rule, there is always an exception. For the gubernatorial lines of succession in Nigeria, the rule is to have the successor throw the predecessor to the curb. Sometimes, it is a deliberate scheme (although the reason is not clear). Other times, it is just the Nigerian political spirit clearing out the old baggage. Few times, if any, has it happened that no rift occurred between an incumbent governor and their predecessor. For this, we might have to praise the successive governments of Bayelsa State. Governor Douye Diri, the incumbent governor of Bayelsa, has once again denied every allegation that there is a conflict between him and his predecessor, Seriake Dickson. According to him, any falling-out that has been reported by supposed media personnel is imaginary and intended to bring harm to the good names of him and Dickson. Dickson, from his end, also declared unflinching support for Diri and his government. He went ahead to label every rumour of conflict between him and Dickson as hogwash, something to be entertained by briefly and then dumped forever. As a result of this position, Dickson also addressed the issue of past conflicts between them, colouring these alleged conflicts with the same brush of hogwash. As it now appears to everybody that Diri and Dickson are in this together, people have taken to minding their business rather than trying to throw a wrench into the relationship between the former governor and his successor. The informed have learned that Diri and Dickson had promised to stay by each other’s side, come rain come sunshine. Thus, it should come as no surprise that every rumour of a rift between the proud gubernatorial figures is being snuffed out. So, with Diri and Dickson, an exception has emerged. And as a reward for this, political figures outside the state have begun referring to the duo as Siamese twins since they appear to be inseparable despite having fairly conflicting opinions.
