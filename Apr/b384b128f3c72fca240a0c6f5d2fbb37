Alex Enumah in Abuja Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court, Abuja on Friday, struck out eight out of  the 15 count terrorism charge filed against leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr Nnamdi Kanu.The judge struck out eight of the counts while ruling on Kanu’s application to dismiss the suit on the grounds of jurisdiction and being incompetent.The affected counts are; 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.The judge in striking out the counts held that they failed to disclose any form of offence alleged to have been committed by the defendant.By the ruling Kanu would now stand trial on counts 1, 2, 3,  4, 5, 8 and 15, which the court believes Kanu needs to respond to. Kanu is standing trial on an amended 15-count charge bordering on treasonable felony. After pleading not guilty to the charge, he asked the court to quash them for being defective and baseless, adding that the court lacked the jurisdiction to try him based on those charges. The application, premised on 34 grounds and supported by a 36-paragraph affidavit, is also seeking an order acquitting and discharging Kanu.
