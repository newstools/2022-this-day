 David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The immediate-past Anambra State Commissioner for Lands, Physical Planning, and Rural Development, Mr. Bonaventure Enemali, has stated that he wants to use his experience to rescue his people from bad governance. Enemali stated this to journalists after purchasing his Expression of Interest and nomination forms to run for a seat in the state House of Assembly to represent Anambra West state constituency. The former commissioner will contest on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). He said: “I have looked into these scenarios and feel that this is the right time for me to come out and represent the people of my constituency at the state legislature, to speak in their favour instead of leaving them with poor representation. “I consider it a sacred duty to use my experience and exposure to represent Anambra West at the state Assembly. I’m stepping out into the race to rescue the ordinary people of Anambra West.” Enemali further stated that the reason he chose the state House of Assembly instead of the National Assembly was because he wants to stay close to the people at the grassroots and also affect their lives. “I believe that the Anambra State legislature is the place I can be-that my representation will have a direct impact on the lives of the people of my constituency. “If I win the election, which I strongly believe I will, I will spend the next four years participating in most of the legislative roles in the state. It will also allow me to look inward to see what we can do to address the challenges of development backwardness in Anambra West.”
