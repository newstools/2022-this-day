Events leading to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ were epochal in the annals of Christianity and humanity. They remind us of his virtues of sacrifice, love, harmony and peaceful coexistence among humanity. “As Christians, this period offers us an opportunity to rethink our relationships as individuals, as communities and as a nation. The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ typifies love, affection and tolerance. It also marked the end of evil and the beginning of good deeds. I want to urge us to emulate the virtues of Jesus Christ by positively impacting the lives of friends, colleagues, associates, neighbours and family members. “As we celebrate this year’s Easter, I want to urge Christian faithful in the state to continue to pray for continuous peace in our dear state, Lagos and end to insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, insurgency and other insecurity challenges in Nigeria.”
