 James Emejo in Abuja The Managing Director/Chief Executive, Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA), Prof Adesoji Adesugba, has said plans have been concluded to address the emerging traffic gridlock arising from the operations of Pinnacle Oil and Gas Free Zone Enterprises (FZE) registered in Lekki Free Zone. The assurance came against the backdrop of concerns raised by the Nigeria Economic Zones Association (NEZA) over the increase in the movement of oil tankers in the Lekki axis after Pinnacle Oil commenced operations. The association’s Executive Secretary, Mr. Toyin Elegbede, had expressed frustration over gridlock as efforts so far made by the association to get both Lekki Free Zone Development Company and the oil company to resolve the emerging traffic crisis had not yielded any results. He said, “This has led to scores of tankers parking on the road, effectively converting it into a truck park thereby affecting flow of traffic and throwing all stakeholders in the axis in a deep state of distress. The current shortage of fuel has exacerbated the issue as it has hampered the operations of other businesses operating from the axis. “This situation, if not tackled early enough, will render the whole axis not conducive for businesses, and this will negatively affect the country’s drive for economic development through the Free Trade Zone scheme. Moreover, it poses significant security and safety threats to the residents in and around these parked tankers.” The NEPZA boss, however, commended the association for its intervention and effectively playing its role as the industry trade association for economic zones in the country.
