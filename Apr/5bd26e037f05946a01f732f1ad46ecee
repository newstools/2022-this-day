 There are still a few good stories in the world and this one is not just a plant to fill space but rather a space to fill with plants. A hotel in Kentucky is allowing visitors to bring their houseplants along and share their sunny environment. Generally, hotels are hesitant to even accept pets so this is a new direction in hospitality although they are less likely to leave a mess anywhere or chew the furniture, even the carnivorous plants. It may be an advertising stunt but it’s still a good initiative and the more that can be done to get people to return to travelling and holidaying the better. There is still so much of the world that is good, and this should plant a great idea in everyone’s head. Dennis Fitzgerald,Melbourne, Australia
