Society Watch Before this era in Africa, women were considered unimportant, except in the kitchen and the bedroom. They were seen only as properties to be kept for home use: mothers, wives and caregivers. But this is changing so fast. Some of these women are becoming liberated. Some have made their debut in various fields of endeavour and are very successful. Today, some are being celebrated worldwide. One of such women is Hajia Aisha Achimugu. She is a renowned businesswoman and a socialite. She is the MD/CEO of Felak Concepts Limited, a company with interests in consultancy services related to health, equipment procurement, training and capacity building. She’s also a director in Altex Engineering Oil & Gas Limited. Achimugu made her mark in maritime and transportation engineering. She is the first woman transaction advisor/consultant to develop a seaport (Ibaka Seaport) in Nigeria. The billionaire business magnate sees education as the indisputable weapon for attaining dreams. She believes that every child, especially the girl child, should be given a chance in life in order to realise her dreams. Life, without education, she adds, dims the prospects for a successful life. The mother of three is never weary of broadening her knowledge in skills and knowledge. She is conscious of the fact that knowledge remains the podium when it comes to business. To succeed, she embraces humility in learning new trends to soar above her contenders. Unlike many other industrialists, this lady of rare gem with the heart of gold is a towering giant in the business world. She takes inspiration from her belief that sees African women as capable of demonstrating commendable resourcefulness and diligence in building their business enterprises.
