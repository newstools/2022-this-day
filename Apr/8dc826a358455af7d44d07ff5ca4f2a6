 Chinedu Eze The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos Command, yesterday intercepted an American citizen with firearms at the airport. The male passenger (names withheld), who arrived the country aboard a United Airlines flight from Houston, United States at 10:10am, was said to have checked-in the firearms. The passenger was also said to be in possession of two international passports – Nigerian and American. A source close to the Lagos airport told newsmen that the American citizen did not declare the firearms as stipulated in international laws on firearms carriage. THISDAY, however, learnt from another inside source at the airport that the passenger had some documentations from the US, which allowed him to carry firearms, but the authenticity of the papers could not be ascertained. About two hours after the arrival of his flight, the passenger was still going through interrogation at the Immigration office at the airport and an official of the organisation said the passenger would be handed over to the appropriate authorities for further questioning. “Officials of the Nigeria Immigration Service actually intercepted the passenger with the firearms during screening. So far, the passenger is undergoing scrutiny from the officials of the service and will be handed over to the relevant authorities after interrogation. “Besides, we learnt that the passenger with dual citizenship has the approval of the US government to carry firearms, but such should have been declared at the port of entry, which he didn’t do. However, we are yet to verify the documents he’s carrying,” Immigration official at the airport said.
