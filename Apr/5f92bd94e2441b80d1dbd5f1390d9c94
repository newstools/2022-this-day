To prioritise deploying emerging technologies in Nigeria’s education sector, the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) has been tasked with ensuring this happens. The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami, disclosed this when he received the Executive Secretary of TETFUND, Sunday Echono, in his office. He noted that the deployment of blockchain technology in Nigeria’s tertiary institutions would help preserve data integrity and promote efficiency in administering certificates, transcripts, and records. The TETFUND team was at the Communications and Digital Economy Complex, Abuja, to explore collaboration with the Ministry on the Internet for Education, Broadband Penetration, Subsidies Data for Educational Contents, Data Hosting, Digitalisation of Thesis and Facilitation of Hybrid Education. Pantami said, “The deployment of blockchain technology in Nigeria’s tertiary institutions will help preserve data integrity and promote efficiency in the administration of certificates, transcripts, and records, among others.”By using Blockchain, students cannot alter their creditability like grades, degrees, and certification, thus guaranteeing the employers that the job applicants have the necessary skills for the job post.
