 The Tennis Section of the Lagos Country Club, Ikeja will be on the spotlight from April 11-16 as the Prince Ademiluyi Memorial Tennis Tournament holds. According to Ehi Ujiagbe, the captain of the Tennis Section, no fewer than 60  kids were scheduled to feature. He added that kids were excited at the return of the tournament which was forced to be put on hold for the last few years due to Covid-19. Ujiagbe hinted that the six-day programme, which is the 16th edition, will begin as a clinic and end up as tournament and was open to kids from ages 3-18. He stated that the Ademiluyi Memorial Tournament was one of the legacies of Dr. Ademiluyii, an ardent tennis fan, who was  a staunch member of the tennis section. “Being one of the longest running junior programmes in the club we look forward to a memorable tournament. “It’s a matter of fact that Ademiluyi tournament has helped in the development of Nigerian tennis over the decade as some of the top players both on the junior and senior ranks were product of this programme.” Tennis equipment as well as certificates will be given to kids that excel in the tournament.
