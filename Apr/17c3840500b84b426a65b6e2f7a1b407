 Foursquare Gospel Church in Nigeria has announced plans for its 2022 edition of International Conference for Ministers and Leaders (ICML). According to the Chairman of the Conference’s Organising Committee, Rev. David Adetomiwa, the programme will be hosting ministers and leaders from the West African Sub-region between 25th to 30th April, 2022 at the church camp along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Adetomiwa in a statement revealed that participants from other churches and ministries from within and outside the country will also be attending the conference which is themed, ‘Building Capacity for Relevance’. He said that the conference theme was taken from Mark 9:17-19 in the holy book, adding that the programme was an opportunity to build upon the foundation that had been laid in times past. “It will be a time of intentional development of personal capacity for ministerial and societal influence. Leading a team of highly sought-after conference speakers will be the General Overseer of the Church, Rev. Sam Aboyeji and wife Rev. Mrs. Olabisi Aboyeji. Also to officiate are  Rev. Sam Osaghae, National Secretary of the church, Rev. Yomi Oyinloye and  seasoned Financial Consultant and Wealth Coach, Dr. Adebola Olubanjo amongst  many others,” he said. In a virtual message, inviting all and sundry to the programme, Aboyejiw said, “capacity is the mental, emotional, spiritual and physical ability to do the work of ministry and influence society. The issue of capacity is very crucial to making indelible impact in life and building lasting ministry. Capacity sets a man before kings and people that matter in life. In this year’s ICML, there will be spiritual, physical and financial empowerment for all attendees.” “The opening and closing ceremonies will be transmitted live on the Foursquare Television Channel, WAP TV and all Foursquare Social Media handles. Everyone in position of leadership or aspiring to be a leader is invited to attend this programme,” the statement added.
