 Juliet Akoje in Abuja The House of Representatives has urged the Hajj Commission of Nigeria to suspend the implementation of the Hajj Savings Scheme pending the investigation of the scheme. The House also mandated its Committee on Pilgrims Affairs to investigate the scheme to ascertain the sharing formula on profit that accrue to the stakeholders, Jaiz Plc, NAHCON, State Pilgrims Welfare Boards and other stakeholders. These resolutions followed the adoption of a motion on the need to investigate the savings scheme and temporarily suspend its implementation Hon. Aminu Ashiru-Mani during plenary yesterday. Ashiru-Mani noted that the scheme was established by Section 7 of Hajj Commission to enable intending pilgrims to save towards fulfilling one of the pillars of Islam. He revealed that “the Hajj scheme, Jaiz Bank Plc and Nahcon had in September 2020 signed savings scheme agreement to make it easier for intending pilgrims to gradually plan and save in partnership with Jaiz Bank providing a long saving platform for people who intend to go for hajj. “The saver, Jaiz Bank Plc, NAHCON and State Pilgrims Welfare Boards (SPWBs) in less than two years after Jaiz Bank launched the hajj savings commission hit customer base of over 4000 with N1 billion savings in the account. He expressed concern that there is lack of transparency in the Hajj savings scheme that could lead to corruption in the system. The House, however, mandated its committee on Hajj affairs to review the entire Hajj savings scheme agreement with NAHCON, JAIZ Bank Plto ensure transparency and accountability and report back within two weeks for further legislative action.
