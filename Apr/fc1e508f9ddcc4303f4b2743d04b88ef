HighLife World over, fashion has evolved from being an element of clothing and style to something of personality and character. By current standards, we are as much a product of our lifestyle as are our fashion choices. By the same reasoning, the best-dressed individuals among us are those that are most conscious of their distinctiveness and don’t mind letting the world know that they are awesome. The wife of notable businessman Taofik Adegbite, Tosin is one such person. You can count the number of truly “fashion killers” in Nigeria and come to find that Tosin is at the top of the list. Accompanying her gait is always a powerful colour co-ordination- a true formation that speaks of her careful mix of shades of colour, and other spots-on wardrobe decisions around what shoes to wear and by extension, how best to wear the pride of an accomplished woman without belittling others around her. To say that Tosin is simply a fashion forward person is to put it lightly. In recent times, the lady has come to be known as one of the cynosures of interest and guidance in the fashion industry. Despite not being a model in the industry, she has managed to upend the standards once adhered to for no reason other than inherited tradition, and now sets fashion trends like the paragon she is. Tosin’s darling husband, Taofik, is known as one of the biggest Lagos Boys around at this time. As Taofik is a very private man, it is Tosin that demonstrates to all and sundry that the title of Lagos Big Boy is not wasted on her husband. For every jingle of luxurious accessories and rare pieces, Tosin shows the world the stuff she is made of. If we do not have interests, we wouldn’t be interesting. If Tosin doesn’t have fashion, she wouldn’t be Tosin.
