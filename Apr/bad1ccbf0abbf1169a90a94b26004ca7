 John Keats the English poet wrote that ‘a thing of beauty is a joy forever whose loveliness increases without end.’ This is one way to describe the marriage of Chris and Ijeoma Ubosi. Recently, the happy couple celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary to the joy and delight of their family and friends. For anybody who knows Chris, the Chairman of Megaletrics, owners of Beat FM, Classic FM, and Naija FM, it isn’t news that his marriage is his cornerstone. Being a man of such influence and affluence, Chris has been asked time and again what his secret is. He would humbly reply that it is the grace of God that brought him thus far. And then he would quickly chip in the fact that his wife comes in second place after his maker. Some couples are like ordinary jigsaws with sharp ends colliding without fail. The marriage of Chris and Ijeoma is nothing like this: a jigsaw it is, that is true, but they complement each other with their nooks and edges. It is thus no surprise that they are celebrating two decades and a half of marital bliss. A few years ago when they celebrated their 20th anniversary, Nigerians were already cheering them on. Unlike the Chris and Ijeoma union, many couples with a similarly high level of influence have long lost the spark in their marriage and are only just getting along for the sake of their children. But for the Ubosis, love is not love if it is not directed at each other. And five years have flown by since then and they are stronger. As Chris has mentioned, he and Ijeoma are now looking forward to their 50th anniversary. That would be the bomb indeed!
