 There are considerations in matters and activities involving corporate entities. In Nigeria, where everyone likes to pretend that sincere religious tolerance exists, every spark that looks like a slight against one religious belief or another is the beginning of a hurricane. That is what Sterling Bank has done with their outrageous if not blasphemous advert about Easter. For those who are just coming to know about it, Sterling Bank posted an Easter advert in which they inadvertently compared the resurrection of Jesus Christ to the rise of Agege Bread. Or, as some are reporting it, where Sterling Bank compared Agege Bread to Jesus. In truth, what the bank posted was “Like Agege Bread, He Rose” by which they were referring to the historical resurrection of Jesus. Of course, the advert has not gone down well with many Nigerians. The majority had taken to referring to Sterling Bank as the den of the devil, the silo of satanic schemes, and several other titles that are best kept out of print. But the question must be asked: was this a joke gone too far or is there something sinister in the background? One cannot imagine how a prestigious banking institution like Sterling Bank would commit such a miserable error. As the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) is calling it, Sterling Bank has joined hands with those who have nothing but evil in mind for Christians in Nigeria. Thus, words like hostility, hate, etc. are being thrown around as descriptions of Sterling’s advert. As things stand now, it is not looking good for Sterling Bank. CAN has even called for the resignation of the bank’s Chief Executive, Abubakar Suleiman. Whether or not this request will be granted to appease the association remains unknown. What is known is that Sterling Bank has crossed a religious line, and nothing good comes from such things.
