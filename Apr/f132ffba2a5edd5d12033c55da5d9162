Chiemelie Ezeobi Operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) yesterday  intercepted a bus fully laden with illicit drugs at the Mile 2 area of Lagos State. The drugs, which were loaded in a Lagos colour LT bus, with the registration number AGL 205 YD, belong to one Alhaji, better known as General in Mushin. According to the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, a member of the drug syndicate confessed that they picked up the consignment, which has a street value of about N10 million at Alaba Rago around last Saturday for shipment to Mushin. Luck, however, ran out on them when RRS officials on patrol stopped the bus on a routine check.Another member of the syndicate, Oluwole Omojuyitan, aged 40, who had initially escaped the scene on bike was arrested by the operatives after he came back with N500,000 to bribe the officers to release the drugs and suspects. Other arrested members of the gang include Ojukwu Omanogho, aged 36 and Hope Jumbo, aged 40.The Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, while commending the Commander of  RRS, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi and the team has since directed that the suspects and exhibits be transferred to the command headquarters for further investigations.
