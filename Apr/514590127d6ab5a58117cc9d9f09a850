Victor Ogunje in Ado-Ekiti Oyebanji Campaign Organisation in Ekiti State, Hon. Cyril Fasuyi, has boasted that the state voters will abort the reelection bid of the Social Democratic Party’s candidate, Segun Oni, in  the June 18 governorship  poll.In the same fashion, Fasuyi added that the candidate of the  Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Bisi Kolawole would meet  “his waterloo on election day,” describing him as lacking requisite experience to govern the state.He said his party (APC) was neither threatened nor rattled by the SDP and PDP candidates, noting that the APC was firmly on ground and well-fortified to win the impending election with wide margin.The APC campaign DG stated this yesterday at Ido-Ekiti, while addressing party’s executives from  the wards in Ido/Osi Local Government Area of the state.He said the outstanding performance of the APC-led government under Governor Kayode Fayemi and Oyebanji intimidating credentials are good enough to speak for the party in the coming election.Fasuyi declared that the APC would record a landslide victory in the election, calling on electorate to reject the SDP and PDP because they lacked the in-built capacity to make life abundant for them.He said: “The SDP candidate, Chief Segun Oni, had had his times managing the affairs of the state and failed woefully to make meaningful impacts in the lives of the people.“Go round the state, Oni and his party lacked the structures and wherewithal to secure victory in the poll, but APC is strong and well-entrenched across the 177 wards in the state. So, we are undaunted and waiting to make surprises in this election.”Fasuyi, while also interfacing with party leaders in Ekiti Central senatorial district in Aramoko Ekiti, Ekiti West LGA, described the June 18 election as a “must-win” for the APC, urging members to wake from their slumber and work hard.According to him, “You know we have 16 local government areas and our candidate, Biodun Oyebanji, is from this council area, so you must not fail to deliver. The SDP candidate is from Ido/ Osi, my own council. This election is a two-horse race, the third party, SDP, is not in contention. We have to be steadfast and work hard. We must bring back those who defected.“We have 22 governors in APC, we have ministers, we have about 71 senators and even the president is a member of the APC, so we will all work together on election day to win this election free and fair.”Also infusing confidence in party members, former state Chairman of the party, Chief Jide Awe, urged them not to allow scrambling for tickets to divide the party and prevent APC from winning the coming election.He said: “We have seen people fight over state and National Assembly tickets; don’t allow this to divide us. We must know that the governorship election is more important than any other contest. If we get it right in the governorship, others will be easier.”
