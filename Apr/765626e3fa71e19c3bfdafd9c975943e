HighLife Signs of the 2023 presidential election are already on the horizon. Coalition groups are rising from corners never before seen to put forward individuals with little or no political bearing. However, there are a few individuals whose potential presidential declaration might tip the scale entirely and change the political landscape. The Vice President of Nigeria, Yemi Osinbajo, is one such person. However, whereas Osinbajo has been mentioned time and again as the best candidate to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari, the man himself is silent. Some say that this is because of his relationship with Bola Tinubu. It is a fact recognised by all and sundry that VP Osinbajo is a gentleman. He has always maintained the persona of someone with an immense appreciation for the unity and progress of Nigeria. Also, he is an intellectual who has shown repeatedly that he can reason and be reasoned with. Thus, he will make the perfect president. Or so the argument goes. But what is stopping him from agreeing to the demands of countless people who want him to declare his intention to contest the apex political position? According to some of the powers that be, regardless of how Osinbajo feels about being president come 2023, he is not likely to join the race. And that is because his godfather, Tinubu, is also one of the contestants for the presidential chair. Thus, for Osinbajo to participate in the presidential scuffle, he would have to go against -rather than support -Tinubu. Anybody else would have no problem with this – just not Osinbajo. Thus, the consensus among the informed is that Osinbajo is more likely to throw his weight – and how majestic this weight – behind his godfather, Tinubu, rather than throw his hat into the ring. To do otherwise, which is what many are suggesting, would go against the gentleman persona that Osinbajo is known to have. Then again, no gentleman ever lasted long in power, so maybe Osinbajo will change his mind? Time will tell.
